# Preface.

This volume has for its object the bringing together and coordinating of the observations which have been made up to the present time on the spectra of the various orders of cosmical bodies, in connection with laboratory work on which I have been engaged since 1868. It embodies in a connected form, among other matters, various Reports presented by me to the Solar Physics Committee, and subsequently communicated to the Royal Society; the President of the latter body having given me permission to utilise them as I have done in the present publication.

The work now considered follows logically upon researches which suggested that many solar phenomena might owe their origin to the falls of meteoritic masses upon the sun's surface. This subject I dealt with in a former book, _The Chemistry of the Sun_, published in 1887, to which, in fact, the present volume is the natural sequel.

Since the book has been in type, advances have been made in several of the lines of inquiry touched upon --- the photographic study of nebular spectra may be cited as an instance --- which I should have gladly included; but as no new point of theoretical importance has been raised, I have thought it better not to delay publication in order to treat them in detail.

It may be that I should have added a final chapter, giving an account of the objections raised to the views here expressed. I have not done this because such objections as have been formulated have dealt only with small details of no fundamental importance for the hypothesis as a whole; and because, so far, it has been difficult for any one to deal with the hypothesis in its generality, in consequence of the number of separate memoirs in which the results obtained from time to time have been published.

It is not in the nature of things that a large mass of detailed work and inquiry which has taken my assistants and myself three years to get together shall be found free from error, especially since observations made by many men in many lands, frequently under conditions of great difficulty, form part of the basis of the discussion. Nor, again, is it likely or even desirable that the general hypothesis, if it be found of any value at all, shall not be improved when fresh minds are brought to bear upon it.

When the time arrives, I shall profit more than any one else by any valid objections that may be raised, and I shall be careful to reply to or accept them.

As the work proceeded many crucial tests were found, _e. g._ in the so-called continuous spectrum of some nebulae, the spectra of bright-line stars, and the differentiation of stars of Vogel's Class 2a into two groups, for which a telescope of large aperture was essential. In the body of the work I express my obligations to Mr. Common, F. R. S., and the Brothers Henry, of the Paris Observatory, for the assistance they have rendered in enabling me to apply the tests in question.

My thanks are due in this place to Professor A. S. Herschel, F. R. S., who permitted me to consult him on the early portions of the book dealing with luminous meteors, and was kind enough to look over the proofs; and also to Mr. Knott, who has freely permitted me to draw on his knowledge of the phenomena of variable stars.

I must also express my obligations to Mr. Roberts for generously permitting me to reproduce some of his marvellous photographs of nebulae, and to Professor Pickering for forwarding to me some of the equally wonderful photographs of stellar spectra, which worthily form the basis of the Draper Memorial.

Among the assistants, on whose skill and industry I have relied for carrying out the details of the various investigations and the general reductions of observations, I must first mention Mr. Fowler, the Demonstrator of Astronomical Physics in the Normal School, whose aid has been quite invaluable, and whose keen interest in the work has never flagged. To Messrs. Taylor and Gregory I have chiefly looked for bringing together the work done at other observatories which has been discussed in this volume. Different branches of the laboratory and observatory work have fallen at different times upon Messrs. Atkins, Spencer, Porter, Baxandall, Coppen, and Sergeant Kearney, R. E.

# Part 1. The Fall and Nature of Meteorites.

## Chapter 1. Ancient and Modern Records of Falls.

Although Natural Science as a whole is a product of the modern world, this is by no means true of all branches of it; in some, by diving into the history of the past, we become acquainted with the phenomena which most forcibly impressed early man, and the effect produced by them on his mind.

Such an historical retrospect is of special interest in connection with the subject-matter of this book, for we learn from it that the falls of "stones from heaven" have been as constant in times past as in times present, and we are brought face to face with the stupendous awe inspired among whole peoples by what were considered to be omens coming visibly and directly from the Immortal Gods. The word omen really understates the old belief, for in many cases meteorites were placed in temples and regarded as the impersonations of the deities, even in Greece as well as in the East. In the temple of Aphrodite at Paphos and in that of Apollo at Delphi a conical stone stood in the place of an image; these were in all probability meteorites like the image at Ephesus, mentioned by St. Paul.

The earliest fall recorded in the annals of the Western world dates from 1478 B. C. It happened in Crete, but the record is much more doubtful than that of the falls in 705 and 654 B. C., noted, the first by Plutarch, and the second by Livy.

But it is agreed on all hands that the first fall to which the greatest interest attaches was observed in the Thracian Chersonesus, on the banks of the river Ægospotamos, 468 B. C. Aristotle, Plutarch, Pliny,* and other ancient authors refer to the circumstances of the fall, which are also recorded in the Parian chronicle engraved on marble, which is now one of the glories of the University Galleries at Oxford.* This meteorite was as large as two millstones. It is noteworthy that in connection with it Anaxagoras was accused of having predicted the fall of this and others from the sun, which he regarded as a molten fiery mass.*

*) _N. H._ vol. 2. p. 59.

*) I learn from Professors Pritchard and Gardner that the upper half of the marble slab disappeared at Arundel House many years ago.  The remaining part is so damaged by weather and probably by fire that no intelligible photograph of any part of it could be taken. A transcription of the marble, made when it was far better preserved, is given in Boeckh's _Corpus Inscriptionum Græcorum_, vol. 2. p. 293, 2374.

*) _Cosmos_, Otté's translation, vol. 1. p. 110.

Whatever its origin, it was held in veneration by the Thracians, and the subsequent defeat of the Athenians in the neighbourhood was attributed to its virtues. Humboldt relates that the African traveller Brown made a journey to Thrace to find it, but without success.

M. Daubrée, in his volume on the _Interior of the Earth_,* has collected together much interesting information relating to the next great historic fall --- that at Pessinuntia in Phrygia in 264 B. C. This became the object of a special cult --- that of Cybele, the mother of the gods. The Decemviri, charged with the custody of the Sibylline leaves, declared that the presence of the stone would bring about the expulsion of the Carthaginians from Italy, and with the consent of Attala it was brought to Rome with splendid pomp, which clearly indicates to us how firmly its divine nature and origin were believed in. The oracle of Delphi, on being consulted, declared that the most honest man should take charge of it. The Senate having declared that Scipio Nasica was that man, he proceeded to Ostia amidst general rejoicing and accompanied by a train of noble Roman ladies, who in turn bore it back to its appointed resting-place, the Temple of Victory. The stone itself was small and black, and had been mounted in silver; the visible part bore a resemblance to a human face.

*) _Régions invisibles du Globe et des Espaces célestes_, International Scientific Series, p. 150.

The above instances --- they might be considerably multiplied--- will give an idea of the belief firmly held by the ancients that meteorites were of non-terrestrial origin, and of the superstitious veneration accorded to them in consequence.

A perusal of the Chinese annals --- which reach back to the year 644 before our era, and are still models of patient record --- shows also in the most definite manner that since the very commencement of human history, in the East as well as in the West, falls of bodies on to the earth from external space have been noticed. Biot has traced in Ma-tuan-lin the record of sixteen falls from the date before mentioned to 333 A. D.

Many meteorites fell during the Middle Ages, but they were no longer regarded as celestial omens, though they were considered worthy of the notice of emperors. One that fell in 1492 at Ensisheim in Alsace was, by the orders of the Emperor Maximilian, hung in the church by an iron chain, and it is still preserved in the town hall.

In more modern times, naturally a keener and more intelligent observation, combined with a larger inhabited area, has largely increased the number of recorded falls. It will be sufficient if we here refer to some that have fallen in Britain.

The first is stated to have occurred in 1622 in Devonshire. The second in 1628 in Berkshire. The circumstances of this latter fall are recorded in a very rare tract, a copy of which is in the British Museum; its title runs ---

Looke Vp and See Wonders: a miraculous Apparition in the Ayre, lately seen in Barke-shire at Bawlkin Greene, neere Hatford, 9th April 1628. (Imprinted at London for Roger Mitchell.)

It begins as follows ---

So Benummed wee are in our Sences, that albeit God himselfe Holla in our Eares, wee by our Wills are loath to heare him. His dreadfull Pursiuants of _Thunder_ and _Lightning_ terrifie vs so long as they have vs in their fingers, but beeing off, wee dance and sing in the midst of our Follies.

Then, proceeding to his task, the author tells how

the foure great quarter-masters of the World (_the foure Elements_)... have bin in ciuill warres one against another... As for Fire, it hath denied of late to warme vs, but at vnreasonable rates, and extreame hard conditions. But what talke I of this earthy nourishment of _fire_? How have the _Fires_ of Heaven (some few years past) gone beyond their bounds, and appeared in the shapes of Comets and Blazing Starres?... The _Aire_ is the shop of Thunder and Lightning. In that, hath of late bin held a Muster of terrible enemies* and threatners of Vengeance, which the great Generall of the Field, who Conducts and Commands all such Armies (_God Almighty, I meane_) auert from our Kingdome, and shoote the arrowes of his indignation some other way, upon the bosomes of those that would confound his Gospell... Many windowes hath he set open in Heaven, to shewe what Artillery hee has lying there, and many of our Kings have trembled, when they were shewne vnto them. What blazing Starres (euen at Noone-dayes) in those times hung houering in the Aire? How many frightfull Ecclipses both of Sun and Moone?... It is not for man to dispute with God, why he has done this so often... but, with feare and trembling casting our eyes vp to Heauen, let us now behold him, bending his Fist onely, as lately he did to the terrour and affrightment of all the Inhabitants dwelling within a Towne in the County of Barkshire... The name of the Towne is _Hatford_, some eight miles from _Oxford_. Ouer this Towne, vpon Wensday being the ninth of this instant Moneth of _April_ 1628, about five of the clocke in the afternoone this miraculous, prodigious, and fearefull handyworke of God was presented... The weather was warme, and without any great shewe of distemperature, only the skye waxed by degrees a little gloomy, yet not so darkened but that the Sunne still and anon, by the power of the brightnesse, brake through the thicke clouds...

*) Dr. Flight thus describes the vignette: "The quaint vignette of this pamphlet gives such a graphic and awe-inspiring representation of 'heaven's artillery' as would strike terror even into Petruchio's heart. The heavens are depicted laid out as a scroll; and, with hurricanes blowing, drums beating, and demi-culverins and sakers discharging meteorites, we witness the airy armies 'grappling in the central blue.'"

A gentle gale of wind then blowing from betweene the West and North-west, in an instant was heard, first a hideous rumbling in the _Ayre_, and presently after followed a strange and feare-full peal of Thunder, running up and downe these parts of the Countrey, but it strake with the loudest violence, and more furious tearing of the _Ayre_, about a place called _The White Horse Hill_, than in any other. The whole order of this thunder carried a kind of Maiesticall state with it, for it maintayned (to the offrighted Beholders' seeming) the fashion of a fought Battaile.

It beganne thus: First, for an onset, went off one great Cannon as it were of _thunder_ alone, like a warning peece to the rest that were to follow. Then a little while after was heard a second; and so by degrees a third, vntill the number of 20 were discharged (or there-abouts) in very good order, though in very great terror.

In some little distance of time after this was audibly heard the sound of a Drum beating a Retreate. Amongst all these angry peales shot off from Heauen, this begat a wonderful admiration, that at the end of the report of euery cracke, or _Cannon-thundering_, a hizzing Noyse made way through the _Ayre_, not unlike the flying of _Bullets_ from the mouthes of great Ordnance; and by the judgment of all the terror-striken witnesses they were _Thunder-bolts_. For one of them was seene by many people to fall at a place called Bawlkin Greene, being a mile and a half from Hatford: Which _Thunder-bolt_ was by one Mistris _Greene_ caused to be digged out of the ground, she being an eye-witnesse, amongst many other, of the manner of the falling.

The form of the _Stone_ is three-square, and picked in the end: In colour outwardly blackish, somewhat like Iron: crusted over with that blacknesse about the thicknesse of a shilling. Within it is a soft, of a gray colour, mixed with some kind of minerall, shining like small peeces of glasse.*

*) Of the stones which fell at Siena, Italy, on the 16th of June 1794, one is thus described: "Von Aussen war er schwarz, wie eine Kohle, inwendig aschgrau, und mit Stücken von Metall vermengt." --- Von Ende, _Massen und Steine_, _etc._, p. 50.

This _Stone_ brake in the fal: The whole peece is in weight nineteene pound and a halfe: The greater peece that fell off weigheth five pound, which with other small peeces being put together, make foure and twenty pound and better...

It is in the Countrey credibly reported that some other Thunder-stones* have bin found in other places: But for certainty there was one tapen vp at _Letcombe_, and is now in the custody of the _Shriefe_.

*) Dr. Flight is of opinion that this is the earliest use of this term, which is found in the beautiful song of "Guiderius and Arviragus," _Cymbeline_, Act 4. Scene 2.

About the beginning of the present century other falls were recorded in these islands.

In England there fell a stone in the afternoon of 13th December 1795. A labourer happened to be working near Wold Cottage, Thwing, Yorkshire, when this stone fell within a few yards of him. On digging the stone out of the ground it was found to have penetrated a foot of soil and half a foot of chalk rock, and to weigh 56 lb. The inhabitants of the neighbouring villages likened the explosion to the firing of guns at sea, while in two of them the sounds were so distinct of something rushing through the air towards Wold Cottage that some of the people went to see if anything extraordinary had happened.

The next account is from Ireland. It is the narrative of an eyewitness of a fall of meteorites in the county of Limerick.

Friday morning, the 10th of September 1813, being very calm and serene, and the sky clear, about nine o'clock, a cloud appeared in the east, and very soon after I heard eleven distinct reports appearing to proceed thence, somewhat resembling the discharge of heavy artillery. Immediately after this followed a considerable noise not unlike the beating of a large drum, which was succeeded by an uproar resembling the continued discharge of musketry in line. The sky above the place whence this noise appeared to issue became darkened and very much disturbed, making a hissing noise, and from thence appeared to issue with great violence different masses of matter, which directed their course with great velocity in a horizontal direction towards the west. One of these was observed to descend; it fell to the earth, and sank into it more than a foot and a half, on the lands of Scagh, in the neighbourhood of Patrick's Well, in the county of Limerick. It was immediately dug up, and I have been informed by those that were present, and on whom I could rely, that it was then warm and had a sulphurous smell. It weighed about 17 lb., and had no appearance of having been fractured in any part, for the whole of its surface was uniformly smooth and black, as if affected by sulphur or gunpowder. Six or seven more of the same kind of masses, but smaller, and fractured, as if shattered from each other or from larger ones, descended at the same time with great velocity in different places between the lands of Scagh and the village of Adare. One more very large mass passed with great rapidity and considerable noise at a small distance from me; it came to the ground on the lands of Brasky, and penetrated a very hard and dry earth about 2 feet. This was not taken up for two days; it appeared to be fractured in many places, and weighed about 65 lb.! Its shape was rather round, but irregular. It cannot be ascertained whether the small fragments which came down at the same time corresponded with the fractures of this large stone in shape or number, but the unfractured part of the surface has the same appearance as the one first mentioned. There fell also at the same time, on the lands of Faha, another stone, which does not appear to have been part of or separated from any other mass; its skin is smooth and blackish, of the same appearance with the first mentioned; it weighed about 74 lb.; its shape was very irregular, for its volume was very heavy... It was about 3 miles in a direct line from the lands of Brasky, where the very large stone descended, to the place where the small ones fell in Adare, and all the others fell intermediately; but they appeared to descend horizontally, and as if discharged from a bomb and scattered in the air.*

*) Quoted by Maskelyne, "Lecture Notes on Meteorites," _Nature_, 1875, vol. 12. p. 485.

Among the most trustworthy records of falls in more recent years are the following. The first deals with the fall of the meteorite of 1885, near Mazapil, in Mexico.  It was thus described by an eyewitness vouched for by Professor Bonilla* ---

*) _Nature_, vol. 35. p. 572.

It was about nine in the evening when I went to the corral to feed certain horses, when suddenly I heard a loud hissing noise, exactly as though something red-hot was being plunged into cold water, and almost instantly there followed a somewhat loud thud. At once the corral was covered with a phosphorescent light, and suspended in the air were small luminous sparks as though from a rocket. I had not recovered from my surprise when I saw this luminous air disappear, and there remained on the ground only such a light as is made when a match is rubbed. A number of people from the neighbouring houses came running toward me, and they assisted me to quiet the horses, which had become very much excited. We all asked each other what could be the matter, and we were afraid to walk in the corral for fear of getting burned. When, in a few moments, we had recovered from our surprise, we saw the phosphorescent light disappear, little by little, and when we had brought lights to look for the cause, we found a hole in the ground and in it a ball of fire. We retired to a distance, fearing it would explode and harm us. Looking up to the sky we saw from time to time exhalations or stars, which soon went out, but without noise.* We returned after a little, and found in the hole a hot stone, which we could barely handle, which on the next day we saw looked like a piece of iron; all night it rained stars, but we saw none fall to the ground, as they seemed to be extinguished while still very high up.

*) The meteorite fell during a star shower.

The next record of the phenomena attending a fall in the United States (though the observer quoted did not actually see the fall) is taken from a lecture by Professor Newton* ---

*) _Nature_, vol. 19. p. 315.

The observers (he says) who stood near to the line of the meteor's flight, were quite overcome with fear, as it seemed to come down upon them with a rapid, increase of size and brilliancy, many of them wishing for a place of safety, but not having the time to seek one. In this fright the animals took a part, horses shying, rearing, and plunging to get away, and dogs retreating and barking with signs of fear. The meteor gave out several marked flashes in its course, one more noticeable than the rest... Thin clouds of smoke and vapour followed in the track of the meteor... From one and a half to two minutes after the dazzling, terrifying, and swiftly moving mass of light had extinguished itself in five sharp flashes, five quickly recurring reports were heard. The volume of sound was so great that the reverberations seemed to shake the earth to its foundations; buildings quaked and rattled, and the furniture that they contained jarred about as if shaken by an earthquake; in fact, many believed that an earthquake was in progress. Quickly succeeding, and blended with the explosions, came hollow bellowings and rattling sounds, mingled with clang, and clash, and roar, that rolled away southward, as if a tornado of fearful power was retreating upon the meteor's path.

About 800 lb. of stones, nearly 200 in number, have been picked up in a region 7 miles by 4, a little east of the end of the meteor's path, which without any doubt came from the meteor. Some were picked up on the surface of the frozen ground. One was found on the top of a snow-bank, and about 40 feet away were marks of a place where it had first struck the ground. Some were ploughed up in the spring. The two largest found, of 74 lb. and 48 lb., fell by the roadside, and a lawsuit to settle whether they were the property of the finder as being wild game, or of the owner of the lands adjacent as being real estate, was decided in favour of the owner of the land.

## Chapter 2. The Physical Characteristics of Meteorites.

The first thing that strikes every one on looking for the first time at a collection of meteorites is that their general form has the character of being fragmentary, so that the idea is suggested that each meteorite is the result of a fracture.

The next point observed is that there is a very great difference between the interior and exterior appearances of these bodies. That this is due to the heat and friction to which the exterior surface has been exposed in its passage through the air, frequently at a very high velocity, is proved by what was noticed in the case of a meteorite that fell at Butsura in 1861. Fragments of this stone were picked up 3 or 4 miles apart, and, with the exception of one corner, the original meteorite has been built up again by piecing the fragments together. The faces fit perfectly. Important pieces of this meteorite are in the British Museum, and these are all coated with the crust, to which reference will be made. But, on the other hand, another of these fragments _not coated_ fits another also not coated. Hence, to quote Professor Maskelyne ---

We can assert that this aërolite acquired, after coming into our atmosphere, a scoriated and blackened surface or incrustation. The first explosion drove the fragments first alluded to asunder, and these became at once incrusted on their broken surfaces; but others which were separated afterwards, probably on the last of the three explosions, had not sufficient velocity left [the heat being at the same time reduced] to cause their incrustation in the same manner as was the case with the fragments previously severed.*

*) "On the Structure and Origin of Meteorites," _Nature_, vol. 15. p. 495.

The supposition is that the temperature is practically high enough to melt the meteorite, and that its surface as we see it after it has fallen does not in all cases represent the surface exposed to the air during the whole of the flight, but that it represents the last surface. The meteorite may have been twenty times bigger, but the rest may have been melted-off like tallow would be, so that finally there is very little visible effect towards the interior, as the melting is more rapid than the conduction. The thinness of the so-called crust or varnish, then, is caused by the air molecules carrying away the results of fusion as fast as the heat penetrates towards the interior, so leaving only, as a rule, a very thin film behind.

[Fig. 1. --- Mazapil Meteoric Iron (3/4 natural size), showing Thumb-Marks.]()

This crust is usually dull, but sometimes, as in the Stannern meteorite, bright and shining, like a coating of black varnish. Sorby,* on examining with a microscope a thin section of a meteorite, cut perpendicular to the crust, found that it is a true black glass filled with small bubbles, and that the contrast between it and the main mass of the meteorite is as complete as possible, the junction between them being sharply defined, except when portions have been injected a short distance between the crystals. He writes ---

*) "Lecture Notes," _loc. cit._ p. 487.

We thus have a most complete proof of the conclusion that the black crust was due to the true igneous fusion of the surface under conditions which had little or no influence at a greater depth than 1/100 of an inch. In the case of meteorites of different chemical composition, the black crust has not retained a true glassy character, and is sometimes 1/50 of an inch in thickness, consisting of two very distinct layers, the internal showing particles of iron which have been neither melted nor oxidised, and the external showing that they have been oxidised and the oxide melted up with the surrounding stony matter. Taking everything into consideration, the microscopical structure of the crust agrees perfectly well with the explanation usually adopted, but rejected by some authors, that it was formed by the fusion of the external surface, and was due to 'the very rapid heating which takes place when a body moving with planetary velocity rushes into the earth's atmosphere --- a heating so rapid that the surface is melted before the heat has time to penetrate beyond a very short distance into the interior of the mass.

In some cases close under the crust is found a mixture of the minerals troilite, asmanite, and bronzite, of an unaltered light brown colour, although they turn deep black when raised to a temperature slightly above that at which lead melts.*

*) Flight, _History of Meteorites_, p. 169.
 The crust or varnish of the meteorite in many cases contains numerous furrows and ridges, so that it is not equally thick. This effect is caused, as it is supposed, by its motion through the air in a fixed position, the forward part of the meteorite, in regard to its line of motion, being most liquefied, and the liquid flowing unequally towards the hinder part.

A very special study of the results of the passage through the air is a desideratum. Thus, in the case of the Tennessee iron, which fell without sign of explosion, and therefore probably with a low velocity, the outer surface is elaborately reticulated, edges of thin laminae of metal inclined at angles of 60° traversing it. Hence no fusion of the superficial layer took place.*

*) Flight, _History of Meteorites_, p. 108.

Another peculiarity of the surface is that it is generally covered with small depressions called "thumb-marks," as they have been likened to the impressions that one makes when pressing some such substance as putty with the thumb or finger. The cause of these marks is unknown, but they have been found to bear a close resemblance to the irregular depressions which have been noticed on grains of gunpowder blown out on firing large guns.

A possible cause of these pittings is thus suggested by Professor Maskelyne ---

The aerolite comes into our atmosphere from regions in which the temperature --- "the cold of space" --- may range as low as 140° C. below zero, and though the mass, from the absorption of solar heat, would possess a temperature much above this, it would nevertheless be intensely cold, and consequently more brittle than at ordinary temperatures; and hence, on its entering our atmosphere, the heat it instantaneously acquires on its outer portion expands this, and tends to tear it away, so as to dissever the exterior from the interior, which continues to be relatively contracted by the intensity of the cold which the aërolite brings with it from space. The consequence is, first, that little bits of the stone spring out all over it, leaving those curious little holes or pit-marks which are characteristic of a meteorite; and every now and then, as the heat penetrates, larger masses split away, of which interesting evidence is afforded by the meteorite, for instance, that fell at Butsura on 12th May 1861.

On this it may be remarked that the pittings are common to irons and stones, while the above explanation only applies to stones.

It is not a little worthy of notice that the pitting does not always appear on all the surfaces. In the case of a meteorite which fell in Kentucky in 1877, one portion of it is very extensively and regularly pitted, while the rest is comparatively smooth. The crust is dull black, and is as perfect as when the stone fell. There was a fresh broken spot of two or three square centimetres, which was evidently made prior to the fall, for a few small specks of the melted matter adhered to the surface.*

*) _Ibid._ p. 200.

These meteorites, which we can thus examine, are in all probability, for the most part, remnants of larger bodies which had enough substance in them to stand the wear and tear of getting through our atmosphere.

The fragments picked up even from the most extensive falls have appeared to those who have witnessed, or who have subsequently studied, the phenomena, to be strangely small in comparison to the violence and magnitude of the apparent explosion and the luminous effects observed.

Some of the startling results produced by the passage of meteorites through the air have already been referred to in the last chapter. They include terrific noises, sometimes like the loudest thunder and at others the booming of distant guns, or even rifle-fire. Clouds are seen suddenly produced in a clear sky, long luminous trails are seen, and in some cases the light produced is so intense as to be seen in broad daylight.

The intensity of all these phenomena may safely be attributed to the enormous velocity with which the meteorites reach the earth's atmosphere. This and the consequent effect upon the meteorites themselves we must now briefly discuss.

In some cases of observed falls the rate of movement of the meteorite through the air has been determined, or concomitant circumstances have enabled it to be roughly estimated. The velocities have been widely different. Before they are stated, some terms of comparison may be given ---

|Metres per second.|Miles an hour.  
Railway trains|27 nearly|60  
Flight of swallow|30 to 40|67 to 92  
Projectiles|300 to 400|670 to 920  
Sound|335 1/3 nearly|750  
Mercury, Movement in Orbit|48,900|109,358  
Venus, Movement in Orbit|36,780|83,162  
Earth, Movement in Orbit|30,430|68,052  
Mars, Movement in Orbit|24,650|55,135  

The highest velocity of flight through the air has been that of the Stannern meteorites, 45 miles a second. The lower part of the flight of the Iowa meteorite was performed at 12 miles a second.

In only a few cases have the velocities been observed to be very great at the earth's surface, the retarding effect of the passage through the atmosphere being considerable. Some have buried themselves deeply in the ground, and one (New Concord) broke a railway-sleeper. Several meteorites have fallen so rapidly that the sound of the explosion _followed_ them. But generally the rate is so slow that they are not broken on striking the surface, and some that fell at Hessle on ice only rebounded without cracking it.

A complete explanation of the origin of the concomitant phenomena so universally recorded is not without its difficulties. M. Daubrée some time ago called in question the explosion hypothesis which has been so generally accepted, and Mr. Hirn has recently given attention to this problem, endeavouring to show that the conditions are similar to those present when thunder is produced by the rapid passage of a flash of lightning.

He writes* ---

*) _Nature_, vol. 35. p. 304.

The sound which we call thunder is due, as everybody knows, to the fact that the air traversed by an electric spark, that is, a flash of lightning, is suddenly raised to a very high temperature, and has its volume moreover considerably increased. The column of gas thus suddenly heated and expanded is sometimes several miles long; as the duration of the flash is not even a millionth of a second, it follows that the noise bursts forth at once from the whole column; but for an observer in any one place it commences where the lightning is at the least distance. In precise terms, the beginning of the thunderclap gives us the minimum distance of the lightning; and the length of the thunderclap gives us the length of the column. It must be remarked that when a flash of lightning strikes the ground, it is not necessarily from the place struck that the first noise is heard.

We have already seen that meteorites penetrate the air with a velocity of 40,000 or even 60,000 metres per second. With that velocity the air is at once raised to a temperature of from 4000° to 6000° C. Because the meteorite is travelling at a velocity about fifty times greater than that of the air molecules themselves, the result is that there is a tremendous crowding of air, so to speak, in front of the meteorite, a tremendous pressure, and therefore a tremendous temperature brought about by its passage. There is a partial vacuum behind, which subsequently has to be filled up by the transit of the molecules round the meteorite itself from the front part to the back.

We have therefore conditions for producing most violent action upon the meteorite, both by pressure and temperature; it may be crushed by the pressure to which it is subjected; it may be melted by the heat produced by the circulation of the molecules rushing past it. We may therefore have violent incandescence and explosion, and as we have the air molecules rushing violently from front to rear, we shall have almost the noise of a thunderstorm added to the sudden luminosity resembling lightning. The matter on the surface of the meteorite will be torn away by the violence of the gaseous friction produced, and will be vaporised at the same time by the heat. This is undoubtedly the origin of the smoke which meteorites leave trailing behind them.

We have, then, precisely as in the case of lightning, a long narrow column of air, which is expanded; not so instantaneously certainly as by lightning, but at all events in an extremely short time and through a great length. Under these circumstances we should have the production of sound in the one case as in the other: a clap of thunder followed by a rolling noise more or less prolonged. Hence we need not regard an actual explosion as necessary to produce the noise generally heard.

Projectiles from guns whistle; but if a cannon-ball could have imparted to it a velocity of 100,000 metres per second, it would no longer whistle --- it would thunder; and at the same time it would produce a flash, as of lightning, and would be speedily burnt up.

The observers of actual falls have heard other special noises, not like thunder, due to the rapid passage of the meteorites through the air --- from the whistle or "ping" of a rifle bullet to the hum of a locomotive --- sounds which have been likened to the tearing of linen, the lowing of cattle, or the flapping of wings.

These sounds have been heard when the meteorite, travelling with greatly reduced velocity, has nearly reached the earth's surface. They are due to the fact that the air, rapidly pushed on one side in front of the projectile (whether bullet or meteorite), quickly rushes back to fill the gap left in the rear.

We can best study the differences in the structure of meteorites by preparing polished sections. In some cases these have a distinctly metallic look. We find, in fact, metallic fragments composed almost entirely of iron, but with a certain amount of nickel.

The nickel in the iron meteorites causes them to have a whitish appearance, and it is from this cause that they have been mistaken for silver when found, the nickel preventing the outer surfaces from rusting as is the case with ordinary iron.

By taking a polished section, and exposing it to the action of an acid or bromine, we obtain what have been called the "figures of Widmanstätten." These figures are more or less complicated, and remarkable for their extreme regularity; they are due to the inequality of the action of the acid on the various constituents of the polished surface; these being various alloys of iron and nickel.

In other specimens the characteristic is that the metal, instead of being continuous as in those previously referred to, appears to have existed once as a spongy paste, and to have included fragments of stony matter, so that in the section, instead of getting the pure metallic lustre all along, we only get it here and there. We pass from metal to metal _plus_ stone.

In yet other specimens we get another generic case represented in which the stone is the main point and the metal the exception, the metal appearing as excessively small granules; so that in the final term of the series we come to almost pure stone, with no iron to speak of.

In the case of the stones, not only does the meteorite itself give the idea of a fragment, as in the case of the irons, but the internal structure of many of them shows that the whole meteorite is composed of fragments, giving the characteristics of a brecciated rock, that is, one made up of pieces cemented together.

Further, these constituent particles, as pointed out by Sorby, are often themselves mere fragments, although the entire body, before being broken, may originally have been only 1/40 or 1/50 of an inch in diameter.

On examining thin sections of stony meteorites by means of polarised light, they are found to be crystallised throughout, the interference tints colouring the different crystals of which the sections are composed, thus showing the crystalline character of the whole. The stony part of both siderolites and aërolites is almost entirely crystalline, and presents a peculiar "chondritic" structure, which makes meteorites differ from ordinary terrestrial rocks; the loose grains are found to be more or less aggregated into little spherules, and to be of similar minerals to those which enclose them.

[Fig. 2. --- Section of Mazapil Meteoric Iron (natural size), showing Widmanstätten Figures.]()

These spherules, or chondroi --- their sizes varying very considerably, some of them being seen only under a microscope, while others are as large as a cherry --- are found embedded in a matrix, made up, as it appears, of minute splinters such as would result from the disintegration of other chondroi.

While the chondroi in terrestrial rocks, such as perlite, obsidian, pitchstone, and many diorites, are radiate-fibrous, those occurring in meteorites are but rarely so, and the arrangement of the fibres within the spherule is eccentric. While the meteoritic chondroi also consist of the same ingredients as the matrix, and often differ from it only in being more coarsely granular, the chondroi of terrestrial rocks are differently constituted from the matrix.*

The weight of meteorites varies very considerably, ranging from tons to very small specimens. It not only depends on their volume but on their chemical composition, as some --- the stony ones --- have a low density, while the "irons" are of nearly pure metal.

The largest meteorites of which mention is made are those of Otumpa (province of Tucuman, South America), an iron weighing 30 tons; of Durango (Mexico), 19 tons; and of Cranbourne (Australia), now in the British Museum, which weighs over 3 tons.

The Nejed iron, the largest which has been seen to fall, weighs nearly 130 lb. Considering the very considerable number of falls which have taken place, the number of irons which have been _seen to fall_ is remarkably small. They are as follows ---

Agram, 1751.  
Tennessee, 1835.  
Braunau, 1847.  
Victoria West (South Africa), 1862.  
Nejed, 1863.  
Nidigullam (Madras), 1870.  
Rowton, Shropshire, 1876.  
Mazapil, 1885.  
Cabin Creek, 1886.

The following table contains a list of some of the larger meteorites, besides those mentioned above, which have been found from time to time, with the locality of their fall and their weights in grammes (1000 grammes = 2.2 lb. avoirdupois (nearly), and 1,018,181 grammes (nearly) = 1 ton):---

_Classification of Meteorites._

Meteorites have been arranged in three classes: first, masses of iron alloyed with nickel, which have been called by Maskelyne aëro-siderites (_aer_, air, and _sideros_, iron), or briefly siderites; secondly, those which are almost wholly composed of stone, and called aërolites (_aer_, air, and _lithos_, stone); and thirdly, those which are composed of stone and iron in more or less equal quantities, consisting of a spongy mass of iron interlaced with stony matter like that of the aërolites, and called siderolites or meso-siderites.

M. Daubrée's general classification of meteorites is as follows ---

Meteorites  
->Containing metallic iron  
-->Not containing stony matter  
--->Holosidères  
-->Containing iron with stony matter  
--->The iron constituting a matrix which encases stony grains  
---->Syssidères  
--->The iron existing in the form of grains among stony matter  
---->Sporadosidères  
->Not containing metallic iron  
-->Asidères

This brings us to consider the chemistry of these messengers from the celestial spaces.
