# Preface.

This volume has for its object the bringing together and coordinating of the observations which have been made up to the present time on the spectra of the various orders of cosmical bodies, in connection with laboratory work on which I have been engaged since 1868. It embodies in a connected form, among other matters, various Reports presented by me to the Solar Physics Committee, and subsequently communicated to the Royal Society; the President of the latter body having given me permission to utilise them as I have done in the present publication.

The work now considered follows logically upon researches which suggested that many solar phenomena might owe their origin to the falls of meteoritic masses upon the sun's surface. This subject I dealt with in a former book, _The Chemistry of the Sun_, published in 1887, to which, in fact, the present volume is the natural sequel.

Since the book has been in type, advances have been made in several of the lines of inquiry touched upon --- the photographic study of nebular spectra may be cited as an instance --- which I should have gladly included; but as no new point of theoretical importance has been raised, I have thought it better not to delay publication in order to treat them in detail.

It may be that I should have added a final chapter, giving an account of the objections raised to the views here expressed. I have not done this because such objections as have been formulated have dealt only with small details of no fundamental importance for the hypothesis as a whole; and because, so far, it has been difficult for any one to deal with the hypothesis in its generality, in consequence of the number of separate memoirs in which the results obtained from time to time have been published.

It is not in the nature of things that a large mass of detailed work and inquiry which has taken my assistants and myself three years to get together shall be found free from error, especially since observations made by many men in many lands, frequently under conditions of great difficulty, form part of the basis of the discussion. Nor, again, is it likely or even desirable that the general hypothesis, if it be found of any value at all, shall not be improved when fresh minds are brought to bear upon it.

When the time arrives, I shall profit more than any one else by any valid objections that may be raised, and I shall be careful to reply to or accept them.

As the work proceeded many crucial tests were found, _e. g._ in the so-called continuous spectrum of some nebulae, the spectra of bright-line stars, and the differentiation of stars of Vogel's Class 2a into two groups, for which a telescope of large aperture was essential. In the body of the work I express my obligations to Mr. Common, F. R. S., and the Brothers Henry, of the Paris Observatory, for the assistance they have rendered in enabling me to apply the tests in question.

My thanks are due in this place to Professor A. S. Herschel, F. R. S., who permitted me to consult him on the early portions of the book dealing with luminous meteors, and was kind enough to look over the proofs; and also to Mr. Knott, who has freely permitted me to draw on his knowledge of the phenomena of variable stars.

I must also express my obligations to Mr. Roberts for generously permitting me to reproduce some of his marvellous photographs of nebulae, and to Professor Pickering for forwarding to me some of the equally wonderful photographs of stellar spectra, which worthily form the basis of the Draper Memorial.

Among the assistants, on whose skill and industry I have relied for carrying out the details of the various investigations and the general reductions of observations, I must first mention Mr. Fowler, the Demonstrator of Astronomical Physics in the Normal School, whose aid has been quite invaluable, and whose keen interest in the work has never flagged. To Messrs. Taylor and Gregory I have chiefly looked for bringing together the work done at other observatories which has been discussed in this volume. Different branches of the laboratory and observatory work have fallen at different times upon Messrs. Atkins, Spencer, Porter, Baxandall, Coppen, and Sergeant Kearney, R. E.

# Part 1. The Fall and Nature of Meteorites.

## Chapter 1. Ancient and Modern Records of Falls.

Although Natural Science as a whole is a product of the modern world, this is by no means true of all branches of it; in some, by diving into the history of the past, we become acquainted with the phenomena which most forcibly impressed early man, and the effect produced by them on his mind.

Such an historical retrospect is of special interest in connection with the subject-matter of this book, for we learn from it that the falls of "stones from heaven" have been as constant in times past as in times present, and we are brought face to face with the stupendous awe inspired among whole peoples by what were considered to be omens coming visibly and directly from the Immortal Gods. The word omen really understates the old belief, for in many cases meteorites were placed in temples and regarded as the impersonations of the deities, even in Greece as well as in the East. In the temple of Aphrodite at Paphos and in that of Apollo at Delphi a conical stone stood in the place of an image; these were in all probability meteorites like the image at Ephesus, mentioned by St. Paul.

The earliest fall recorded in the annals of the Western world dates from 1478 B. C. It happened in Crete, but the record is much more doubtful than that of the falls in 705 and 654 B. C., noted, the first by Plutarch, and the second by Livy.

But it is agreed on all hands that the first fall to which the greatest interest attaches was observed in the Thracian Chersonesus, on the banks of the river Ægospotamos, 468 B. C. Aristotle, Plutarch, Pliny,* and other ancient authors refer to the circumstances of the fall, which are also recorded in the Parian chronicle engraved on marble, which is now one of the glories of the University Galleries at Oxford.* This meteorite was as large as two millstones. It is noteworthy that in connection with it Anaxagoras was accused of having predicted the fall of this and others from the sun, which he regarded as a molten fiery mass.*

*) _N. H._ vol. 2. p. 59.

*) I learn from Professors Pritchard and Gardner that the upper half of the marble slab disappeared at Arundel House many years ago.  The remaining part is so damaged by weather and probably by fire that no intelligible photograph of any part of it could be taken. A transcription of the marble, made when it was far better preserved, is given in Boeckh's _Corpus Inscriptionum Græcorum_, vol. 2. p. 293, 2374.

*) _Cosmos_, Otté's translation, vol. 1. p. 110.

Whatever its origin, it was held in veneration by the Thracians, and the subsequent defeat of the Athenians in the neighbourhood was attributed to its virtues. Humboldt relates that the African traveller Brown made a journey to Thrace to find it, but without success.

M. Daubrée, in his volume on the _Interior of the Earth_,* has collected together much interesting information relating to the next great historic fall --- that at Pessinuntia in Phrygia in 264 B. C. This became the object of a special cult --- that of Cybele, the mother of the gods. The Decemviri, charged with the custody of the Sibylline leaves, declared that the presence of the stone would bring about the expulsion of the Carthaginians from Italy, and with the consent of Attala it was brought to Rome with splendid pomp, which clearly indicates to us how firmly its divine nature and origin were believed in. The oracle of Delphi, on being consulted, declared that the most honest man should take charge of it. The Senate having declared that Scipio Nasica was that man, he proceeded to Ostia amidst general rejoicing and accompanied by a train of noble Roman ladies, who in turn bore it back to its appointed resting-place, the Temple of Victory. The stone itself was small and black, and had been mounted in silver; the visible part bore a resemblance to a human face.

*) _Régions invisibles du Globe et des Espaces célestes_, International Scientific Series, p. 150.

The above instances --- they might be considerably multiplied--- will give an idea of the belief firmly held by the ancients that meteorites were of non-terrestrial origin, and of the superstitious veneration accorded to them in consequence.

A perusal of the Chinese annals --- which reach back to the year 644 before our era, and are still models of patient record --- shows also in the most definite manner that since the very commencement of human history, in the East as well as in the West, falls of bodies on to the earth from external space have been noticed. Biot has traced in Ma-tuan-lin the record of sixteen falls from the date before mentioned to 333 A. D.

Many meteorites fell during the Middle Ages, but they were no longer regarded as celestial omens, though they were considered worthy of the notice of emperors. One that fell in 1492 at Ensisheim in Alsace was, by the orders of the Emperor Maximilian, hung in the church by an iron chain, and it is still preserved in the town hall.

In more modern times, naturally a keener and more intelligent observation, combined with a larger inhabited area, has largely increased the number of recorded falls. It will be sufficient if we here refer to some that have fallen in Britain.

The first is stated to have occurred in 1622 in Devonshire. The second in 1628 in Berkshire. The circumstances of this latter fall are recorded in a very rare tract, a copy of which is in the British Museum; its title runs ---

Looke Vp and See Wonders: a miraculous Apparition in the Ayre, lately seen in Barke-shire at Bawlkin Greene, neere Hatford, 9th April 1628. (Imprinted at London for Roger Mitchell.)

It begins as follows ---

So Benummed wee are in our Sences, that albeit God himselfe Holla in our Eares, wee by our Wills are loath to heare him. His dreadfull Pursiuants of _Thunder_ and _Lightning_ terrifie vs so long as they have vs in their fingers, but beeing off, wee dance and sing in the midst of our Follies.

Then, proceeding to his task, the author tells how

the foure great quarter-masters of the World (_the foure Elements_)... have bin in ciuill warres one against another... As for Fire, it hath denied of late to warme vs, but at vnreasonable rates, and extreame hard conditions. But what talke I of this earthy nourishment of _fire_? How have the _Fires_ of Heaven (some few years past) gone beyond their bounds, and appeared in the shapes of Comets and Blazing Starres?... The _Aire_ is the shop of Thunder and Lightning. In that, hath of late bin held a Muster of terrible enemies* and threatners of Vengeance, which the great Generall of the Field, who Conducts and Commands all such Armies (_God Almighty, I meane_) auert from our Kingdome, and shoote the arrowes of his indignation some other way, upon the bosomes of those that would confound his Gospell... Many windowes hath he set open in Heaven, to shewe what Artillery hee has lying there, and many of our Kings have trembled, when they were shewne vnto them. What blazing Starres (euen at Noone-dayes) in those times hung houering in the Aire? How many frightfull Ecclipses both of Sun and Moone?... It is not for man to dispute with God, why he has done this so often... but, with feare and trembling casting our eyes vp to Heauen, let us now behold him, bending his Fist onely, as lately he did to the terrour and affrightment of all the Inhabitants dwelling within a Towne in the County of Barkshire... The name of the Towne is _Hatford_, some eight miles from _Oxford_. Ouer this Towne, vpon Wensday being the ninth of this instant Moneth of _April_ 1628, about five of the clocke in the afternoone this miraculous, prodigious, and fearefull handyworke of God was presented... The weather was warme, and without any great shewe of distemperature, only the skye waxed by degrees a little gloomy, yet not so darkened but that the Sunne still and anon, by the power of the brightnesse, brake through the thicke clouds...

*) Dr. Flight thus describes the vignette: "The quaint vignette of this pamphlet gives such a graphic and awe-inspiring representation of 'heaven's artillery' as would strike terror even into Petruchio's heart. The heavens are depicted laid out as a scroll; and, with hurricanes blowing, drums beating, and demi-culverins and sakers discharging meteorites, we witness the airy armies 'grappling in the central blue.'"

A gentle gale of wind then blowing from betweene the West and North-west, in an instant was heard, first a hideous rumbling in the _Ayre_, and presently after followed a strange and feare-full peal of Thunder, running up and downe these parts of the Countrey, but it strake with the loudest violence, and more furious tearing of the _Ayre_, about a place called _The White Horse Hill_, than in any other. The whole order of this thunder carried a kind of Maiesticall state with it, for it maintayned (to the offrighted Beholders' seeming) the fashion of a fought Battaile.

It beganne thus: First, for an onset, went off one great Cannon as it were of _thunder_ alone, like a warning peece to the rest that were to follow. Then a little while after was heard a second; and so by degrees a third, vntill the number of 20 were discharged (or there-abouts) in very good order, though in very great terror.

In some little distance of time after this was audibly heard the sound of a Drum beating a Retreate. Amongst all these angry peales shot off from Heauen, this begat a wonderful admiration, that at the end of the report of euery cracke, or _Cannon-thundering_, a hizzing Noyse made way through the _Ayre_, not unlike the flying of _Bullets_ from the mouthes of great Ordnance; and by the judgment of all the terror-striken witnesses they were _Thunder-bolts_. For one of them was seene by many people to fall at a place called Bawlkin Greene, being a mile and a half from Hatford: Which _Thunder-bolt_ was by one Mistris _Greene_ caused to be digged out of the ground, she being an eye-witnesse, amongst many other, of the manner of the falling.

The form of the _Stone_ is three-square, and picked in the end: In colour outwardly blackish, somewhat like Iron: crusted over with that blacknesse about the thicknesse of a shilling. Within it is a soft, of a gray colour, mixed with some kind of minerall, shining like small peeces of glasse.*

*) Of the stones which fell at Siena, Italy, on the 16th of June 1794, one is thus described: "Von Aussen war er schwarz, wie eine Kohle, inwendig aschgrau, und mit Stücken von Metall vermengt." --- Von Ende, _Massen und Steine_, _etc._, p. 50.

This _Stone_ brake in the fal: The whole peece is in weight nineteene pound and a halfe: The greater peece that fell off weigheth five pound, which with other small peeces being put together, make foure and twenty pound and better...

It is in the Countrey credibly reported that some other Thunder-stones* have bin found in other places: But for certainty there was one tapen vp at _Letcombe_, and is now in the custody of the _Shriefe_.

*) Dr. Flight is of opinion that this is the earliest use of this term, which is found in the beautiful song of "Guiderius and Arviragus," _Cymbeline_, Act 4. Scene 2.

About the beginning of the present century other falls were recorded in these islands.

In England there fell a stone in the afternoon of 13th December 1795. A labourer happened to be working near Wold Cottage, Thwing, Yorkshire, when this stone fell within a few yards of him. On digging the stone out of the ground it was found to have penetrated a foot of soil and half a foot of chalk rock, and to weigh 56 lb. The inhabitants of the neighbouring villages likened the explosion to the firing of guns at sea, while in two of them the sounds were so distinct of something rushing through the air towards Wold Cottage that some of the people went to see if anything extraordinary had happened.

The next account is from Ireland. It is the narrative of an eyewitness of a fall of meteorites in the county of Limerick.

Friday morning, the 10th of September 1813, being very calm and serene, and the sky clear, about nine o'clock, a cloud appeared in the east, and very soon after I heard eleven distinct reports appearing to proceed thence, somewhat resembling the discharge of heavy artillery. Immediately after this followed a considerable noise not unlike the beating of a large drum, which was succeeded by an uproar resembling the continued discharge of musketry in line. The sky above the place whence this noise appeared to issue became darkened and very much disturbed, making a hissing noise, and from thence appeared to issue with great violence different masses of matter, which directed their course with great velocity in a horizontal direction towards the west. One of these was observed to descend; it fell to the earth, and sank into it more than a foot and a half, on the lands of Scagh, in the neighbourhood of Patrick's Well, in the county of Limerick. It was immediately dug up, and I have been informed by those that were present, and on whom I could rely, that it was then warm and had a sulphurous smell. It weighed about 17 lb., and had no appearance of having been fractured in any part, for the whole of its surface was uniformly smooth and black, as if affected by sulphur or gunpowder. Six or seven more of the same kind of masses, but smaller, and fractured, as if shattered from each other or from larger ones, descended at the same time with great velocity in different places between the lands of Scagh and the village of Adare. One more very large mass passed with great rapidity and considerable noise at a small distance from me; it came to the ground on the lands of Brasky, and penetrated a very hard and dry earth about 2 feet. This was not taken up for two days; it appeared to be fractured in many places, and weighed about 65 lb.! Its shape was rather round, but irregular. It cannot be ascertained whether the small fragments which came down at the same time corresponded with the fractures of this large stone in shape or number, but the unfractured part of the surface has the same appearance as the one first mentioned. There fell also at the same time, on the lands of Faha, another stone, which does not appear to have been part of or separated from any other mass; its skin is smooth and blackish, of the same appearance with the first mentioned; it weighed about 74 lb.; its shape was very irregular, for its volume was very heavy... It was about 3 miles in a direct line from the lands of Brasky, where the very large stone descended, to the place where the small ones fell in Adare, and all the others fell intermediately; but they appeared to descend horizontally, and as if discharged from a bomb and scattered in the air.*

*) Quoted by Maskelyne, "Lecture Notes on Meteorites," _Nature_, 1875, vol. 12. p. 485.

Among the most trustworthy records of falls in more recent years are the following. The first deals with the fall of the meteorite of 1885, near Mazapil, in Mexico.  It was thus described by an eyewitness vouched for by Professor Bonilla* ---

*) _Nature_, vol. 35. p. 572.

It was about nine in the evening when I went to the corral to feed certain horses, when suddenly I heard a loud hissing noise, exactly as though something red-hot was being plunged into cold water, and almost instantly there followed a somewhat loud thud. At once the corral was covered with a phosphorescent light, and suspended in the air were small luminous sparks as though from a rocket. I had not recovered from my surprise when I saw this luminous air disappear, and there remained on the ground only such a light as is made when a match is rubbed. A number of people from the neighbouring houses came running toward me, and they assisted me to quiet the horses, which had become very much excited. We all asked each other what could be the matter, and we were afraid to walk in the corral for fear of getting burned. When, in a few moments, we had recovered from our surprise, we saw the phosphorescent light disappear, little by little, and when we had brought lights to look for the cause, we found a hole in the ground and in it a ball of fire. We retired to a distance, fearing it would explode and harm us. Looking up to the sky we saw from time to time exhalations or stars, which soon went out, but without noise.* We returned after a little, and found in the hole a hot stone, which we could barely handle, which on the next day we saw looked like a piece of iron; all night it rained stars, but we saw none fall to the ground, as they seemed to be extinguished while still very high up.

*) The meteorite fell during a star shower.

The next record of the phenomena attending a fall in the United States (though the observer quoted did not actually see the fall) is taken from a lecture by Professor Newton* ---

*) _Nature_, vol. 19. p. 315.

The observers (he says) who stood near to the line of the meteor's flight, were quite overcome with fear, as it seemed to come down upon them with a rapid, increase of size and brilliancy, many of them wishing for a place of safety, but not having the time to seek one. In this fright the animals took a part, horses shying, rearing, and plunging to get away, and dogs retreating and barking with signs of fear. The meteor gave out several marked flashes in its course, one more noticeable than the rest... Thin clouds of smoke and vapour followed in the track of the meteor... From one and a half to two minutes after the dazzling, terrifying, and swiftly moving mass of light had extinguished itself in five sharp flashes, five quickly recurring reports were heard. The volume of sound was so great that the reverberations seemed to shake the earth to its foundations; buildings quaked and rattled, and the furniture that they contained jarred about as if shaken by an earthquake; in fact, many believed that an earthquake was in progress. Quickly succeeding, and blended with the explosions, came hollow bellowings and rattling sounds, mingled with clang, and clash, and roar, that rolled away southward, as if a tornado of fearful power was retreating upon the meteor's path.

About 800 lb. of stones, nearly 200 in number, have been picked up in a region 7 miles by 4, a little east of the end of the meteor's path, which without any doubt came from the meteor. Some were picked up on the surface of the frozen ground. One was found on the top of a snow-bank, and about 40 feet away were marks of a place where it had first struck the ground. Some were ploughed up in the spring. The two largest found, of 74 lb. and 48 lb., fell by the roadside, and a lawsuit to settle whether they were the property of the finder as being wild game, or of the owner of the lands adjacent as being real estate, was decided in favour of the owner of the land.

## Chapter 2. The Physical Characteristics of Meteorites.

The first thing that strikes every one on looking for the first time at a collection of meteorites is that their general form has the character of being fragmentary, so that the idea is suggested that each meteorite is the result of a fracture.

The next point observed is that there is a very great difference between the interior and exterior appearances of these bodies. That this is due to the heat and friction to which the exterior surface has been exposed in its passage through the air, frequently at a very high velocity, is proved by what was noticed in the case of a meteorite that fell at Butsura in 1861. Fragments of this stone were picked up 3 or 4 miles apart, and, with the exception of one corner, the original meteorite has been built up again by piecing the fragments together. The faces fit perfectly. Important pieces of this meteorite are in the British Museum, and these are all coated with the crust, to which reference will be made. But, on the other hand, another of these fragments _not coated_ fits another also not coated. Hence, to quote Professor Maskelyne ---

We can assert that this aërolite acquired, after coming into our atmosphere, a scoriated and blackened surface or incrustation. The first explosion drove the fragments first alluded to asunder, and these became at once incrusted on their broken surfaces; but others which were separated afterwards, probably on the last of the three explosions, had not sufficient velocity left [the heat being at the same time reduced] to cause their incrustation in the same manner as was the case with the fragments previously severed.*

*) "On the Structure and Origin of Meteorites," _Nature_, vol. 15. p. 495.

The supposition is that the temperature is practically high enough to melt the meteorite, and that its surface as we see it after it has fallen does not in all cases represent the surface exposed to the air during the whole of the flight, but that it represents the last surface. The meteorite may have been twenty times bigger, but the rest may have been melted-off like tallow would be, so that finally there is very little visible effect towards the interior, as the melting is more rapid than the conduction. The thinness of the so-called crust or varnish, then, is caused by the air molecules carrying away the results of fusion as fast as the heat penetrates towards the interior, so leaving only, as a rule, a very thin film behind.

[Fig. 1. --- Mazapil Meteoric Iron (3/4 natural size), showing Thumb-Marks.]()

This crust is usually dull, but sometimes, as in the Stannern meteorite, bright and shining, like a coating of black varnish. Sorby,* on examining with a microscope a thin section of a meteorite, cut perpendicular to the crust, found that it is a true black glass filled with small bubbles, and that the contrast between it and the main mass of the meteorite is as complete as possible, the junction between them being sharply defined, except when portions have been injected a short distance between the crystals. He writes ---

*) "Lecture Notes," _loc. cit._ p. 487.

We thus have a most complete proof of the conclusion that the black crust was due to the true igneous fusion of the surface under conditions which had little or no influence at a greater depth than 1/100 of an inch. In the case of meteorites of different chemical composition, the black crust has not retained a true glassy character, and is sometimes 1/50 of an inch in thickness, consisting of two very distinct layers, the internal showing particles of iron which have been neither melted nor oxidised, and the external showing that they have been oxidised and the oxide melted up with the surrounding stony matter. Taking everything into consideration, the microscopical structure of the crust agrees perfectly well with the explanation usually adopted, but rejected by some authors, that it was formed by the fusion of the external surface, and was due to 'the very rapid heating which takes place when a body moving with planetary velocity rushes into the earth's atmosphere --- a heating so rapid that the surface is melted before the heat has time to penetrate beyond a very short distance into the interior of the mass.

In some cases close under the crust is found a mixture of the minerals troilite, asmanite, and bronzite, of an unaltered light brown colour, although they turn deep black when raised to a temperature slightly above that at which lead melts.*

*) Flight, _History of Meteorites_, p. 169.
 The crust or varnish of the meteorite in many cases contains numerous furrows and ridges, so that it is not equally thick. This effect is caused, as it is supposed, by its motion through the air in a fixed position, the forward part of the meteorite, in regard to its line of motion, being most liquefied, and the liquid flowing unequally towards the hinder part.

A very special study of the results of the passage through the air is a desideratum. Thus, in the case of the Tennessee iron, which fell without sign of explosion, and therefore probably with a low velocity, the outer surface is elaborately reticulated, edges of thin laminae of metal inclined at angles of 60° traversing it. Hence no fusion of the superficial layer took place.*

*) Flight, _History of Meteorites_, p. 108.

Another peculiarity of the surface is that it is generally covered with small depressions called "thumb-marks," as they have been likened to the impressions that one makes when pressing some such substance as putty with the thumb or finger. The cause of these marks is unknown, but they have been found to bear a close resemblance to the irregular depressions which have been noticed on grains of gunpowder blown out on firing large guns.

A possible cause of these pittings is thus suggested by Professor Maskelyne ---

The aerolite comes into our atmosphere from regions in which the temperature --- "the cold of space" --- may range as low as 140° C. below zero, and though the mass, from the absorption of solar heat, would possess a temperature much above this, it would nevertheless be intensely cold, and consequently more brittle than at ordinary temperatures; and hence, on its entering our atmosphere, the heat it instantaneously acquires on its outer portion expands this, and tends to tear it away, so as to dissever the exterior from the interior, which continues to be relatively contracted by the intensity of the cold which the aërolite brings with it from space. The consequence is, first, that little bits of the stone spring out all over it, leaving those curious little holes or pit-marks which are characteristic of a meteorite; and every now and then, as the heat penetrates, larger masses split away, of which interesting evidence is afforded by the meteorite, for instance, that fell at Butsura on 12th May 1861.

On this it may be remarked that the pittings are common to irons and stones, while the above explanation only applies to stones.

It is not a little worthy of notice that the pitting does not always appear on all the surfaces. In the case of a meteorite which fell in Kentucky in 1877, one portion of it is very extensively and regularly pitted, while the rest is comparatively smooth. The crust is dull black, and is as perfect as when the stone fell. There was a fresh broken spot of two or three square centimetres, which was evidently made prior to the fall, for a few small specks of the melted matter adhered to the surface.*

*) _Ibid._ p. 200.

These meteorites, which we can thus examine, are in all probability, for the most part, remnants of larger bodies which had enough substance in them to stand the wear and tear of getting through our atmosphere.

The fragments picked up even from the most extensive falls have appeared to those who have witnessed, or who have subsequently studied, the phenomena, to be strangely small in comparison to the violence and magnitude of the apparent explosion and the luminous effects observed.

Some of the startling results produced by the passage of meteorites through the air have already been referred to in the last chapter. They include terrific noises, sometimes like the loudest thunder and at others the booming of distant guns, or even rifle-fire. Clouds are seen suddenly produced in a clear sky, long luminous trails are seen, and in some cases the light produced is so intense as to be seen in broad daylight.

The intensity of all these phenomena may safely be attributed to the enormous velocity with which the meteorites reach the earth's atmosphere. This and the consequent effect upon the meteorites themselves we must now briefly discuss.

In some cases of observed falls the rate of movement of the meteorite through the air has been determined, or concomitant circumstances have enabled it to be roughly estimated. The velocities have been widely different. Before they are stated, some terms of comparison may be given ---

|Metres per second.|Miles an hour.  
Railway trains|27 nearly|60  
Flight of swallow|30 to 40|67 to 92  
Projectiles|300 to 400|670 to 920  
Sound|335 1/3 nearly|750  
Mercury, Movement in Orbit|48,900|109,358  
Venus, Movement in Orbit|36,780|83,162  
Earth, Movement in Orbit|30,430|68,052  
Mars, Movement in Orbit|24,650|55,135  

The highest velocity of flight through the air has been that of the Stannern meteorites, 45 miles a second. The lower part of the flight of the Iowa meteorite was performed at 12 miles a second.

In only a few cases have the velocities been observed to be very great at the earth's surface, the retarding effect of the passage through the atmosphere being considerable. Some have buried themselves deeply in the ground, and one (New Concord) broke a railway-sleeper. Several meteorites have fallen so rapidly that the sound of the explosion _followed_ them. But generally the rate is so slow that they are not broken on striking the surface, and some that fell at Hessle on ice only rebounded without cracking it.

A complete explanation of the origin of the concomitant phenomena so universally recorded is not without its difficulties. M. Daubrée some time ago called in question the explosion hypothesis which has been so generally accepted, and Mr. Hirn has recently given attention to this problem, endeavouring to show that the conditions are similar to those present when thunder is produced by the rapid passage of a flash of lightning.

He writes* ---

*) _Nature_, vol. 35. p. 304.

The sound which we call thunder is due, as everybody knows, to the fact that the air traversed by an electric spark, that is, a flash of lightning, is suddenly raised to a very high temperature, and has its volume moreover considerably increased. The column of gas thus suddenly heated and expanded is sometimes several miles long; as the duration of the flash is not even a millionth of a second, it follows that the noise bursts forth at once from the whole column; but for an observer in any one place it commences where the lightning is at the least distance. In precise terms, the beginning of the thunderclap gives us the minimum distance of the lightning; and the length of the thunderclap gives us the length of the column. It must be remarked that when a flash of lightning strikes the ground, it is not necessarily from the place struck that the first noise is heard.

We have already seen that meteorites penetrate the air with a velocity of 40,000 or even 60,000 metres per second. With that velocity the air is at once raised to a temperature of from 4000° to 6000° C. Because the meteorite is travelling at a velocity about fifty times greater than that of the air molecules themselves, the result is that there is a tremendous crowding of air, so to speak, in front of the meteorite, a tremendous pressure, and therefore a tremendous temperature brought about by its passage. There is a partial vacuum behind, which subsequently has to be filled up by the transit of the molecules round the meteorite itself from the front part to the back.

We have therefore conditions for producing most violent action upon the meteorite, both by pressure and temperature; it may be crushed by the pressure to which it is subjected; it may be melted by the heat produced by the circulation of the molecules rushing past it. We may therefore have violent incandescence and explosion, and as we have the air molecules rushing violently from front to rear, we shall have almost the noise of a thunderstorm added to the sudden luminosity resembling lightning. The matter on the surface of the meteorite will be torn away by the violence of the gaseous friction produced, and will be vaporised at the same time by the heat. This is undoubtedly the origin of the smoke which meteorites leave trailing behind them.

We have, then, precisely as in the case of lightning, a long narrow column of air, which is expanded; not so instantaneously certainly as by lightning, but at all events in an extremely short time and through a great length. Under these circumstances we should have the production of sound in the one case as in the other: a clap of thunder followed by a rolling noise more or less prolonged. Hence we need not regard an actual explosion as necessary to produce the noise generally heard.

Projectiles from guns whistle; but if a cannon-ball could have imparted to it a velocity of 100,000 metres per second, it would no longer whistle --- it would thunder; and at the same time it would produce a flash, as of lightning, and would be speedily burnt up.

The observers of actual falls have heard other special noises, not like thunder, due to the rapid passage of the meteorites through the air --- from the whistle or "ping" of a rifle bullet to the hum of a locomotive --- sounds which have been likened to the tearing of linen, the lowing of cattle, or the flapping of wings.

These sounds have been heard when the meteorite, travelling with greatly reduced velocity, has nearly reached the earth's surface. They are due to the fact that the air, rapidly pushed on one side in front of the projectile (whether bullet or meteorite), quickly rushes back to fill the gap left in the rear.

We can best study the differences in the structure of meteorites by preparing polished sections. In some cases these have a distinctly metallic look. We find, in fact, metallic fragments composed almost entirely of iron, but with a certain amount of nickel.

The nickel in the iron meteorites causes them to have a whitish appearance, and it is from this cause that they have been mistaken for silver when found, the nickel preventing the outer surfaces from rusting as is the case with ordinary iron.

By taking a polished section, and exposing it to the action of an acid or bromine, we obtain what have been called the "figures of Widmanstätten." These figures are more or less complicated, and remarkable for their extreme regularity; they are due to the inequality of the action of the acid on the various constituents of the polished surface; these being various alloys of iron and nickel.

In other specimens the characteristic is that the metal, instead of being continuous as in those previously referred to, appears to have existed once as a spongy paste, and to have included fragments of stony matter, so that in the section, instead of getting the pure metallic lustre all along, we only get it here and there. We pass from metal to metal _plus_ stone.

In yet other specimens we get another generic case represented in which the stone is the main point and the metal the exception, the metal appearing as excessively small granules; so that in the final term of the series we come to almost pure stone, with no iron to speak of.

In the case of the stones, not only does the meteorite itself give the idea of a fragment, as in the case of the irons, but the internal structure of many of them shows that the whole meteorite is composed of fragments, giving the characteristics of a brecciated rock, that is, one made up of pieces cemented together.

Further, these constituent particles, as pointed out by Sorby, are often themselves mere fragments, although the entire body, before being broken, may originally have been only 1/40 or 1/50 of an inch in diameter.

On examining thin sections of stony meteorites by means of polarised light, they are found to be crystallised throughout, the interference tints colouring the different crystals of which the sections are composed, thus showing the crystalline character of the whole. The stony part of both siderolites and aërolites is almost entirely crystalline, and presents a peculiar "chondritic" structure, which makes meteorites differ from ordinary terrestrial rocks; the loose grains are found to be more or less aggregated into little spherules, and to be of similar minerals to those which enclose them.

[Fig. 2. --- Section of Mazapil Meteoric Iron (natural size), showing Widmanstätten Figures.]()

These spherules, or chondroi --- their sizes varying very considerably, some of them being seen only under a microscope, while others are as large as a cherry --- are found embedded in a matrix, made up, as it appears, of minute splinters such as would result from the disintegration of other chondroi.

While the chondroi in terrestrial rocks, such as perlite, obsidian, pitchstone, and many diorites, are radiate-fibrous, those occurring in meteorites are but rarely so, and the arrangement of the fibres within the spherule is eccentric. While the meteoritic chondroi also consist of the same ingredients as the matrix, and often differ from it only in being more coarsely granular, the chondroi of terrestrial rocks are differently constituted from the matrix.*

*) Professor Story Maskelyne, _Nature_, vol. 12. p. 504.

The weight of meteorites varies very considerably, ranging from tons to very small specimens. It not only depends on their volume but on their chemical composition, as some --- the stony ones --- have a low density, while the "irons" are of nearly pure metal.

The largest meteorites of which mention is made are those of Otumpa (province of Tucuman, South America), an iron weighing 30 tons; of Durango (Mexico), 19 tons; and of Cranbourne (Australia), now in the British Museum, which weighs over 3 tons.

The Nejed iron, the largest which has been seen to fall, weighs nearly 130 lb. Considering the very considerable number of falls which have taken place, the number of irons which have been _seen to fall_ is remarkably small. They are as follows ---

Agram, 1751.  
Tennessee, 1835.  
Braunau, 1847.  
Victoria West (South Africa), 1862.  
Nejed, 1863.  
Nidigullam (Madras), 1870.  
Rowton, Shropshire, 1876.  
Mazapil, 1885.  
Cabin Creek, 1886.

The following table contains a list of some of the larger meteorites, besides those mentioned above, which have been found from time to time, with the locality of their fall and their weights in grammes (1000 grammes = 2.2 lb. avoirdupois (nearly), and 1,018,181 grammes (nearly) = 1 ton):---

_Classification of Meteorites._

Meteorites have been arranged in three classes: first, masses of iron alloyed with nickel, which have been called by Maskelyne aëro-siderites (_aer_, air, and _sideros_, iron), or briefly siderites; secondly, those which are almost wholly composed of stone, and called aërolites (_aer_, air, and _lithos_, stone); and thirdly, those which are composed of stone and iron in more or less equal quantities, consisting of a spongy mass of iron interlaced with stony matter like that of the aërolites, and called siderolites or meso-siderites.

M. Daubrée's general classification of meteorites is as follows ---

Meteorites  
->Containing metallic iron  
-->Not containing stony matter  
--->Holosidères  
-->Containing iron with stony matter  
--->The iron constituting a matrix which encases stony grains  
---->Syssidères  
--->The iron existing in the form of grains among stony matter  
---->Sporadosidères  
->Not containing metallic iron  
-->Asidères

This brings us to consider the chemistry of these messengers from the celestial spaces.

# Chapter 3. The Chemistry of Meteorites.

We have seen that the main difference between the specimens of these bodies which have been collected is that some of them are mainly iron, some of them are mainly stone; and that there is a passage between these two conditions represented by falls in which we have a paste of iron including stony fragments.

We have now to enter into some points connected with their chemical constitution somewhat more in detail.

Of the chemical elements which are at present recognised as such, about one-fourth are found by chemical analysis to exist in meteorites. These, according to the tables given by Maskelyne,* Fletcher,* Smith, and others are as follows.

*) _Nature_, vol. 12. p. 505.

*) _Introduction to Study of Meteorites_, p. 30.

Those that occur most constantly are ---

Hydrogen  
Calcium  
Iron  
Aluminium  
Nickel  
Carbon  
Magnesium  
Oxygen  
Manganese  
Sulphur  
Cobalt  
Silicon  
Copper*  
Phosphorus  

*) With regard to the presence of cobalt and copper, Dr. L. Smith says (_Mineralogy and Chemistry_, p. 352): "In every analysis that I have made of meteoric irons (over one hundred different specimens) cobalt has been invariably found, along with a minute quantity of copper." --- Flight, _History of Meteorites_, p. 164.

while the following occur less frequently or in smaller quantities:---

Lithium  
Chromium Sodium  
Tin Potassium  
Arsenic Strontium  
Antimony Titanium  
Chlorine Nitrogen  

Of these elementary bodies only hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon occur in an elementary condition. Hydrogen and nitrogen are asserted to be occluded as gases in the stones. Carbon exists both in the form of graphite and diamond.

From the above lists it will be seen that among the elements most common in meteorites are recognised many which have a very wide distribution and exist in great quantities in the surface and envelopes of our planet. But this is true only of the elements.

Many mineral compounds terrestrially common are absent; perhaps the most striking case of all is the absolute absence of free quartz whether crystallised or not from meteorites, while terrestrially it is the most prevalent compound known, and enters into the composition of such common rocks as trachyte, felsite, syenite, gneiss, and granite.

Again, many of the chemical combinations met with are unknown to terrestrial mineralogy. The chemical compounds found in meteorites which are new to our mineralogy may be briefly referred to. Some are combinations with sulphur, as follows ---

Sulphur + Iron = Troilite;  
Sulphur + Calcium = Oldhamite;  
Sulphur + (Calcium, Titanium) = Osbornite;  
Sulphur + (Iron, Chromium) = Daubréelite.  

Phosphides of iron and nickel, forming varieties of so-called schreibersite, are met with.

It has already been stated that carbon in some form or other exists in most meteorites. Some of them are partly composed of this element compounded with hydrogen and oxygen. In this case it exists as a white or a yellowish crystallisable matter, soluble in ether and partly so in alcohol, and exhibiting the characters and the composition of one or more hydrocarbonaceous bodies with high melting-points.

The meteorites of Alais and Cold Bokkeweld are instances of this group. The former is of a black colour both internally and externally, is combustible, and contains sulphates of magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium, which are all soluble in water. The latter, after being experimented upon, left a residue which gave out a very bituminous smell; this substance was yellow, and it was found that it was only another form of carbon in a state of intimate mixture, amounting to about 1.67 per cent.

Some carbonaceous stones are dark gray in colour, have little lustre, and are soft; they contain no visible meteoric iron, but an abundance of light gray rounded bodies, among which are occasionally some with a dull metallic lustre and of a greenish-yellow colour, and others of a dark gray compact substance and of earthy character.*

*) Flight, _op. cit._ p. 211.

Various alloys of nickel and iron also occur; those which play the most important part have, according to Meunier, the following composition:---

|Density.|Formula.  
Tænite|7.380|Fe6Ni  
Plessite|7.850|Fe10Ni  
Kamacite|7.652|Fe14Ni  
Braunine|(?)|Fe16Ni  

Among other minerals we may name ---

Lawrencite, protochloride of iron;  
Maskelynite, with the composition of labradorite;  
Silica (as asmanite).

We now come to the common ground.

The following compounds are identical in composition and crystallographic character with minerals found on our globe:---

Magnetic pyrites|Fe7S8  
Magnetite|Fe3O4  
Chromite|(Fe,Cr)3O4  
Silicates, _viz._ ---  
Olivine varieties.  
Enstatite and bronzite.  
Diopside and augite.  
Anorthite and labradorite.  
Breunnerite.

Among gaseous compounds, the oxides of carbon have been detected in many meteorites, and it is asserted that these gases have been occluded by them in the same manner as the elementary gases hydrogen and nitrogen.

In the "irons" we deal chiefly with nickel-iron, magnesium, manganese, and copper, as metals.

In the "stones" we deal with combinations of magnesium, iron, oxygen, and silicon. One of the most usual substances is called olivine, and sometimes the olivine is in a slightly changed form, in which the quantity of iron is increased, and we get bronzite. Nickel-iron, manganese, and other substances are also found in the stones.

Chemical analysis of the irons has established in them, taken as a whole, the existence of the following mineral species:---

1\. The general metallic mass, which consists of certain alloys, in which iron and nickel predominate to such an extent that the term nickel-iron is by common consent applied to it.

The nickel-iron is an alloy or compound special to meteorites, and the irons are chiefly composed of it. The tracery to which I have referred, observed on the metallic surface treated with acids, was discovered by Widmanstätten. The figures are caused by the crystallisation of the mass: with the iron and nickel magnesium is always associated, _so that we get magnesium in all meteoritic irons_ as well as in the stones.

2\. Compounds of iron and carbon, principally campbelline and chalypite (Fe2C).

3\. Troilite (FeNi)7S8, generally appearing as kidney-shaped masses.

4\. Schreibersite (Fe4Ni2P).

5\. Graphite.

6\. Stony grains, generally magnesium and iron silicates.

7\. Occluded gases.

8\. The crust or varnish. This has been found to be due entirely to the oxidation of the metal. The formula of the crust of the Toluca meteorite, according to Meunier, is Fe2O3(FeNi)O.

The quantities of occluded gases vary considerably. Hydrogen is the first to come out when a vacuum is produced, and in the cold --- that is, when the tube containing the meteorite is not heated.

Thus, Graham found in the Lenarto meteorite, and in a comparative experiment with clean horse-shoe nails made of iron* ---

*) Graham, _Chemical and Physical Researches_, p. 283.

|Meteorite.|Nails.  Hydrogen|85.68|35.0  Carbonic oxide|4.46|50.3  Carbonic acid|...|7.7  Nitrogen|9.86|7.0  |100.00|100.00

Mallet subsequently found in the meteorite picked up in Augusta County* ---

*) _Chemical News_, 21st June 1872.

Hydrogen|85.68  
Carbonic oxide|4.46  
Nitrogen|9.86

Dr. A. Wright subsequently determined the composition of the gases given off at different temperatures, using the Iowa meteorite. The results were as follows ---

|Hydrogen.|Carbonic Oxide.|Carbonic Acid.|Nitrogen.  
Cold|49|14|35|...  
At 100° C.|4.54|0 (?)|95.46|...  
At 200° C.|5.86|1.82|92.32|...  
Red heat.|87.53|0|5.56|6

As regards the so-called occluded gases, iron and stony meteorites, according to Wright, show a marked distinction. While the gases of the Lenarto iron contained 85.68 per cent of hydrogen, those obtained from cosmical masses of the stony kind, such as the Iowa meteorite, are characterised by the presence of carbonic acid, which constitutes nine-tenths of the gas evolved at the temperature of boiling water, and about one-half of that given off at a low red heat.

This view of Wright's has been called in question by Mallet, who refers to his examination of the gases of the iron of Augusta County, Virginia, where the ratio of the oxides of carbon to hydrogen is 4.3, and to his having pointed out in 1872 that hydrogen could no longer be regarded as the characteristic gaseous ingredient of meteoric iron.*

*) Flight, _op. cit._ p. 80.

In the siderites the iron varies from 80 to 98 per cent, and the nickel from 6 to 10 per cent. Sometimes the nickel is found in larger quantities, as in the iron of d'Octibbeha County, Mississippi, found in the year 1854, which contained as much as 59 per cent, while the iron was only 37 per cent.

There is a singular circumstance connected with the varnish of stony meteorites which was observed by Reinsch in the meteorite of Krähenberg. The grains of metallic iron and troilite contained in the varnish show no signs of oxidation. In the meteorite of Morbihan, also, grains of nickel-iron project not only through the smooth inner but also the rough outer crust. It has been suggested that the surface of these meteorites was vitrified before it entered our air, or at all events those lower strata of it in which oxygen is abundant.*

*) _Ib._, _Geological Magazine_, January 1875.

In many cases minute chemical analysis has been most useful in showing that meteorites which have been found in different localities really belong to the same fall.

Professor Nordenskjöld, on examining the Ställdalen meteorites (Sweden, 28th June 1876), found that they resembled some eight or nine others which he had before examined, although they were entirely unconnected as regards their date of appearance; and that together they would form a well-marked group, which, he observes, will probably be found to be only one among many similar groups of aërolites which will hereafter be detected.

Dr. Laurence Smith, from the presence of Daubréelite, inferred a common origin for two meteorites which fell four years apart.*

*) Professor A. S. Herschel, _Monthly Notices_, R. A. S., 1878, p. 219.

The following short table brings together in a compact form the chief substances met with in meteorites. It will indicate the cause of the continued reference to the spectra of magnesium, iron, manganese, and carbon in what follows ---

_Siderites._  
Nickel-iron, manganese, copper.

Schreibersite = iron and nickel phosphide, with which magnesium is always associated.  
Daubréelite = iron and chromium sulphide.  

_Siderolites._  
_Chondritic_ ---  
α\. Non-Carbonaceous ---  
Olivine = chrysolite = peridot = (MgFe)2O4Si = SiO2 41.3, MgO 50.9, FeO 7.7.  
Enstatite MgO3Si = SiO2 60, MgO 40.  
Bronzite = enstatite, in which some magnesium is replaced by iron.  
Nickel-iron, manganese.  
Troilite.  
Chromite = iron protoxide 32, chromium sesquioxide 68, + aluminium and magnesium.  
Augite = pyroxene, SiO2, 55, CaO 23, MgO 16, MnO 0.5, FeO 4.

Bronzite.  
Augite.  
Anorthite.  

# Part 2. The Spectroscopy of Meteorites.

## Chapter 4. Experiments on the Spectra of Metals found in Meteorites.

Many particulars have already been garnered relating to the spectra of those substances met with in meteorites. The next thing is to summarise them. In doing this, we shall not only be bringing together a stock of facts on which we can draw, but various laboratory processes useful in the present inquiry will necessarily be indicated. It need scarcely be said that the experimental work recorded in this and the subsequent chapters forms the basis of all the conclusions, both general and special, which will be given in due course.

A complete history is out of the question here, and to a large extent I limit myself to the work carried on in the Normal School laboratories during the last two years.

When I commenced my researches on meteorites, it soon became evident that the most needful direction in which to work was to observe the phenomena visible at low temperatures. It was obviously important that we should study the spectra of meteorites at various temperatures, high as well as low; but in any case, in order that we might completely unriddle them, it was necessary that we should begin by studying the spectra of those substances which have been found in them, or which they might be suspected to contain.

Obviously, the best way to begin this survey was to start with the lowest temperatures and gradually work up to the highest. We might conveniently begin by observing the spectra at the temperature of the Bunsen burner, then at that of the oxy-coal-gas flame, passing subsequently to those of a comparatively cool electric spark, of the electric arc, and finally of the jar spark.

Much of the high temperature work had been already done. To be completely equipped for the inquiry, then, it was necessary to secure and bring together facts relating to low temperatures. After the phenomena observed by means of the flame of a Bunsen burner had been recorded, the oxy-coal-gas flame was used. In the method of work adopted an ordinary oxyhydrogen blow-pipe jet was employed, coal-gas, as a rule, being substituted for hydrogen. When oxygen is blown through a gas-flame in this way, a long-pointed flame is obtained which is hot enough to fuse platinum, but still is much cooler than the electric spark. The flame is directed very slightly upwards and towards the slit, in the same line as the collimator, and at a distance of 2 or 3 feet from it. A lens of convenient focal length, in this case about 8 or 9 inches, is then placed between the flame and the slit, in such a position that an image of the flame falls exactly on the middle of the slit.

A small portion of the substance to be examined is then supported in a pair of forceps (or on a clean slip of glass) arranged in such a way that it can be raised or lowered by turning a thumb-screw. The substance is then inserted in the flame. Fuller details will be given in Chapter 6 when we come to deal with the analysis of meteorites.

The following table shows the positions of the principal lines, bands, and flutings seen in the spectrum of each of the metals examined, at the two temperatures indicated, arranged roughly in the order of their intensities.

It should here be stated that as some of the researches have had to deal with feeble illumination small dispersion has been of necessity employed; and to make the observations along the several lines comparable, a one-prism spectroscope was in the first instance used throughout. Hence the wave-lengths given are in all cases only approximate. With this proviso the lines observed have been as follows ---

[TABLE]

[Fig. 3. --- Spectra of Metals at the Temperature of the Oxy-Coal-Gas Blowpipe.]()

All the flutings, with the exception of those seen in the case of magnesium, have their maxima towards the blue, and shade off towards the red end of the spectrum.

The map reproduced in Fig. 3 shows the spectra of the various metals at the temperature of the oxy-coal-gas flame; the thick lines represent bands, and the shaded bands represent flutings.

In comparing the spectrum of a substance which has been mapped in the laboratory with the spectrum of a meteorite, we should naturally look for the brightest lines, bands, or flutings first, and hence it is convenient to map the spectra in such a way that we can at once say which characteristic of the spectrum will be the first to appear. We have mainly to consider those bands or flutings which stand out prominently in the spectrum, and are the first to flash out when only a small quantity of substance is volatilised. Thus, in the flame spectrum of barium there is an almost continuous background of flutings with a few brighter bands in the green; here it is most important for us to consider the _bands_, as the flutings mainly add to the general continuous spectrum in the case of radiation, or produce a general dimming of the continuous spectrum in the case of absorption.

Fig. 4 is a map of a few of the more important elements which enter into our discussions, constructed upon this principle. Five orders of intensities are represented, the longest lines, bands, or flutings being the brightest. The lines, bands or flutings, shown on the lowest horizon in the case of each element are those seen at the lowest temperatures, and are the first to make their appearance; everything shown on the lowest horizon is visible at the temperature of the Bunsen burner, but only the brightest phenomena visible at that temperature are represented. Those on the upper horizons are the faintest, and are only seen when the temperature is slightly increased, or a considerable quantity of substance is volatilised.

A glance at the map shows that if there are any indications of magnesium, for instance, in bodies at low temperatures, the fluting at wave-length 500 will be seen, possibly without the other fluting or lines. The first indication of manganese will be the fluting at 558, and so on.

[Fig. 4. --- Spectra of Metals showing the Changes brought about by Change of Temperature.]()

_Experiments upon the Luminous Phenomena of the various Metals volatilised in the Bunsen Burner and the Oxy-coal-gas Blowpipe Flame as compared with the Phenomena seen at higher Temperatures._

In connection with the above work there are some points of interest which may be referred to in this place.

It is important to know whether at low temperatures the phenomena presented by these metals are equally intense, or whether is there a great difference. As a matter of fact there is a great difference, and we can determine the order of visibility, beginning at the substance most easily visible at the lowest temperature.

The main conclusions are that certain lines, bands, and flutings are seen in the Bunsen burner, that a larger number is seen in the flame, but that the total number seen in the burner and flame is relatively small as compared with the lines seen in the spectra at higher temperatures.

The order of visibility in the Bunsen is, roughly ---

_Lines_  
Sodium  
Lithium  
Thallium  
Strontium  
Barium  
Calcium  
Potassium  
Manganese  
Bismuth  

_Bands_  
Calcium  
Strontium  
Barium  

_Flutings_  
Magnesium  
Manganese  

All the observations both of Bunsen and oxyhydrogen flame may be condensed as follows ---

_In metals of the alkalies_  
Sodium  
Potassium  
Lithium  

_In metals of the alkaline earths_  
Calcium  
Strontium  
Barium  

_In magnesian metals_  
Magnesium  
Zinc  
Cadmium  

_In iron metals_  
Iron  
Nickel  
Cobalt  
Manganese  
Chromium  

_In metals which yield acids_  
Bismuth  
Titanium  
Tungsten  

_In copper metals_  
Copper  
Thallium  

_In noble metals_  
Silver  
Mercury  

_In earthy metals_  
Cerium   

_Special Experiments upon Magnesium._

It is also important to study the effect of temperature upon the spectrum. Some experiments upon magnesium may be referred to as giving an idea of the kind of change observed, for this spectrum perhaps brings before us in the most striking manner the beautiful effects produced by the passage from a lower to a higher temperature.

It is generally held that the

Bunsen burner  
Oxy-coal-gas flame  
Electric arc  Spark with jar  

bring before us the effects of different temperatures, increasing in the order in which they have been named; thus we read of spectra seen at the temperature of the Bunsen, arc, _etc._ These terms are fully recognised, and everybody knows what they mean, although the temperature of the Bunsen, and perhaps even the temperature of the arc, does not always remain constant when different substances are introduced into it.

In a paper which I communicated to the Royal Society in 1879* I described the results of some experiments on this spectrum. There are three well-known lines in the green, at wave-lengths 5183, 5172, 5166.7, which are designated _b1_, _b2_, and _b4_, and are characteristic of magnesium. Now in the flame the two least refrangible of these, _b1_ and _b2_, are alone seen, and they are associated with a third line, the remnant of a fluting at 5210, so as to form a triplet. There are also visible a line in the blue and the fluting at 500. On passing to the temperature of the spark, 5210 practically disappears and is replaced by _b4_, the wide triplet thus giving way to a narrower one, _b1_ and _b2_ being common to both, as shown in Fig. 5. At the same time the line in the blue disappears and gives place to two new ones.

*) _Roy. Soc. Proc._ vol. 30. p. 27.

[Fig. 5. --- Changes in the Spectrum of Magnesium. 1. Arc Spectrum. 2. Flame Spectrum.]()

In the Bunsen, as ordinarily employed, the fluting at 500 far eclipses the other parts of the spectrum in brilliancy, and at this temperature I have also photographed a close triplet in the ultraviolet at wave-length 373.

If, however, magnesium be burnt in the hollow of a large Bunsen flame, the fluting at 5210 is seen without the one at 500. This band has been ascribed by Professors Liveing and Dewar to magnesium and hydrogen, not necessarily as a compound, and the one at 500 to oxide of magnesium; but this is by no means proved as yet. It is, however, a point of only secondary importance in the considerations which follow, whether these flutings really proceed from the metals themselves or from compounds of them.

At the highest temperature _b_ is more brilliant than the other lines, and the fluting of 500 has entirely disappeared.

As in magnesium, so also in manganese and lead the change from flutings to lines with increase of temperature is beautifully seen.

At intervals during the last fifteen years I have been engaged in researches on the spectrum of carbon, and there are so many difficulties that even now the research is not completed. The general work has consisted of observations of flames of combustible carbon compounds; the electric arc between carbon poles, and gaseous carbon compounds enclosed in Geissler tubes and rendered incandescent by a current from an induction coil.

A candle consists of certain compounds of carbon, and when burning, these substances are rendered luminous, so that they become capable of giving spectra. If the slit of a spectroscope be directed towards the base of a candle flame, two or three bright flutings of the carbon spectrum will be seen. The upper and more luminous part of the flame gives a perfectly continuous spectrum, because we have there to deal with the incandescence of solid particles.

When a strong electric current is passed between carbon poles, the gases in the space between the poles are rendered incandescent. Some carbon is volatilised, and consequently the spectrum of carbon is observed in that of the electric arc. The spectrum seen, however, depends upon what part of the arc is examined, as some parts are cooler than others. At the negative pole certain flutings are seen, whilst other flutings are special to the positive pole, and others still are characteristic of the long flame which often accompanies the arc. The conditions of the arc also are such that carbon can to a small extent combine with the nitrogen of the air, and the result is that the spectrum of the compound molecules of nitrocarbon is in all probability visible in a certain portion of the arc.

The spectrum of a gas rendered incandescent by an electric current may be obtained in several ways. We may either use a short spark and pass it through the gas at ordinary pressure, or we may enclose the gas in a glass tube fitted with platinum points, connected at one end to a Sprengel pump so that a vacuum can be produced, and at the other end with an apparatus for generating the gas. At reduced pressures, when there is but little of the gas to be rendered incandescent, very long sparks can be made to pass; in my own investigations I have employed tubes of various lengths, the distance between the platinum points varying from about 1/16 of an inch to 6 feet. In all these experiments it is desirable to use what are called end-on tubes, so that the light throughout the length of the tube may be made to fall on the slit of the spectroscope. A form of tube which I have found to be very convenient is shown in Fig. 6. This permits of discharges of various kinds being passed through the same gas without the necessity of changing the tube each time, a change in the pressure, at the most, being all that is required for a change of spark. It will be noted that the tube is partly a capillary tube and partly one with a wide bore; this is very important, as with the same length of spark the temperature is greater in the capillary tube. Simpler forms of end-on tubes have also been employed. In working with a tube of this description, it is best to place it at a distance of about 2 feet from the slit, in the same line as the collimator of the spectroscope, and to focus the light on the slit by interposing a lens of suitable focal length.

[Fig. 6. --- End-on Tube.]()

In these experiments all the joints between the tubes are made air-tight by surrounding the short indiarubber tubes joining them with mercury or glycerine.

The generator, of course, varies according to the nature of the gas to be experimented with. In the case of carbonic acid, for instance, it is convenient to prepare the gas by heating some bicarbonate of soda in a closed combustion tube. The gas is then passed through another part of the tube containing phosphoric anhydride, in order to dry it. This is connected with the spectrum tube, which is again connected with the air pump. The first thing to be done is to get as perfect a vacuum as possible, and then to fill the tube with the gas, and again pump out. This operation having been repeated three or four times, the gas will then be practically pure. Variations of pressure are then obtained by the use of the pump, or by further heating of the combustion tube.

In the case of a liquid like benzole or alcohol, after chemical purification, it is enclosed in a strong bulb, which, by means of a stop-cock tube, is connected with the spectrum tube. The washing-through process in this case necessitates the use of the stop-cock, which is made safe by surrounding it with mercury, as otherwise a vacuum could not be obtained until all the liquid had evaporated.

Other forms of generators have to be used in special cases.

The great difficulty connected with this kind of work is to get rid of traces of impurities of air and moisture. By washing the gas through a great many times, and keeping the apparatus hot, it is possible to obtain the gas practically free from even spectroscopic impurities. In the case of a hydrocarbon like benzole, it is first freed from occluded air and moisture by boiling it in a reflux condenser with chips of sodium. This arrangement allows the liquid to boil away, then recondense and fall back to be again boiled. Sodium has a great affinity for oxygen, and if any water were present, it would at once combine with the oxygen, and liberate hydrogen. In this way the liquid would be freed from oxygen.

The spectra of many compounds of carbon with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, and sulphur have been observed in this way, and it is found that under certain conditions, which vary with the compound experimented upon, there are some flutings common to all. Now these obviously must be due to carbon, since carbon is the only common constituent. The importance of getting rid of all traces of air and moisture will now be clear, as these would form _compounds_ common to all.

This research is beset with difficulties; observers have contradicted each other, have made certain statements, have recanted, and have recanted again. The consensus is certainly now greater than it was formerly, but there are still divergences. The main conclusions which may be stated here are, that there are two systems of flutings which depend upon temperature only. At low temperatures all compounds of carbon give a set of simple flutings, the brightest of which are at wave-lengths 4510, 4830, 5195, and 5610. At higher temperatures there is a series of compound flutings, the brightest edges of which are at wave-lengths 438, 4738, 5165, and 5640. At very high temperatures each compound gives us the _line_ spectra of its constituents. Thus, marsh gas would give us the lines of carbon and hydrogen, and carbonic oxide the lines of carbon and oxygen. The passage from one spectrum to another is not abrupt, but takes place gradually as the temperature is gradually altered.

It is necessary to point out that the temperature at which one particular spectrum is visible is not the same for all compounds of carbon. Thus, since benzole, a compound of carbon and hydrogen, is more easily decomposed than say carbonic oxide, the high temperature fluted spectrum of carbon might be obtained from benzole at the temperature that would only give the cool carbon flutings in the case of carbonic oxide.

Besides these flutings there is another at wave-length 431, which is special to the compounds of carbon containing hydrogen. This fluting is therefore characteristic of hydrocarbon. Another group, consisting of seven flutings, beginning at 460 and extending to 450, is seen when compounds of carbon and nitrogen are broken up.

But even now we have not considered all the flutings of carbon. There are others about which there is room for difference of opinion. These, some ascribe to cyanogen, while I still attribute them to slightly different groupings of the carbon molecules, and these it has been found convenient to call carbon B, to distinguish them from the flutings previously mentioned, which have been called carbon A. These and their relation to temperature are shown in Fig. 7. The principal line of carbon is in the blue part of the spectrum at wave-length 4266. The diagram shows the passage from the line stage to the other stages, first to the ultra-violet group, and then to the less refrangible group. It will be seen that at one temperature both lines and flutings are present. While the blue line gradually thins out, the ultra-violet flutings appear first and grow in intensity. As these increase, the blue flutings become visible, and further, as the latter augment and the line disappears, the ultra-violet flutings die out altogether.

[Fig. 7. --- Part of the Spectrum of Carbon B.]()

There is one other point which is of great importance. This is the variation in the appearance of the blue band beginning at 474. Under some conditions the maximum luminosity of this band is not at 474, but at 468, whilst under other conditions the band is almost uniform from 474 to 461. This is shown in Fig. 8, which is engraved from a photograph of the spectrum of alcohol vapour at three temperatures, the top one being at the highest and the bottom one the lowest temperature.

When we come to study the spectra of those celestial bodies in which carbon appears, we shall see the importance of this; if we had not this evidence, we should not be in a position to assign the same origin to two apparently different bands.

[Fig. 8. --- Change in the Appearances presented by the Band at 474.]()

In what has been said the red end of the spectra has been left out of consideration; it is sufficient to state here that in this region are chiefly found those appearances _special_ to each compound.

_Experiments upon Hydrogen._

I pointed out many years ago that, when under certain conditions the spectrum of hydrogen is examined at the lowest possible temperature, the F (green) line retains its brilliancy long after the C (red) line disappears; and the fact that, after these lines have been made to disappear from the spectral tube, the spectrum which remains visible, and is sometimes very brightly visible, is also due to hydrogen, has always been a matter of thorough belief in my mind, although so many observers, down even to M. Cornu not so very long ago, have been inclined to attribute it to the existence of "impurities."

I began to map the so-called structural spectrum at the College of Chemistry in 1869, but other matters supervened which prevented the accomplishment of this work. This, however, is a matter of small importance, because quite recently Dr. Hasselberg has communicated to the St. Petersburg Academy an admirable memoir on the subject, accompanied by a map (_Mémoires de l'Académie Impériale_, Series 7., vol. 30., No. 7, Hasselberg). The brightest portions of the structure spectrum are shown in Fig. 11.

The most convenient way of obtaining a supply of hydrogen for investigations of this kind is to use a little sodium which has never been in contact with hydrocarbon, or a piece of magnesium wire; to place them in the lower end of a glass tube, one part of which can be used as an end-on tube, and then, after getting a vacuum so perfect that the spark will not pass, to slightly heat the metal. After a time the spectrum of hydrogen, sometimes accompanied by the low temperature flutings of carbon, begins to be visible alike from the sodium and the magnesium.

If the vacuum has been very perfect to start with, at first the bright lines C and F will be visible without any trace of structure, and the hydrogen will be of a magnificent red colour. If now the action of the pump be stopped, and the sodium be still more heated, the colour will change from red to violet, and finally a point will be reached at which the conductibility of the gas is at its maximum, and then, the jar not being in circuit, the structure spectrum of the gas will be seen absolutely alone, without any trace of either C or F. The gradual disappearance of the F line is very striking, and when the bright line is out of the field the lines due to the structure seem to be enhanced in brilliancy.

The brightest part of the spectrum is then that near D; in the blue-green we have a line at 464 more refrangible than F, and then a double line at 4930 and 4935; other less refrangible lines are seen. These are phenomena seen associated with sodium, but if we use the hydrogen produced from a piece of magnesium wire or from a crystal of olivine, under the same circumstances we find that, so far as the lines of hydrogen go, the phenomenon remains the same, but that there is then visible in the spectrum a line at 500, which is in reality the remnant of the fluting at that wave-length which has been recorded in the spectrum of magnesium under other conditions.

## Chapter 6. Spectroscopic Analysis of Meteorites.

_Meteoritic Glows_

A great many investigations of the low temperature spectra of meteorites have been already made, and one method of investigation has been the following:---

A small fragment of any particular meteorite, or still better some dust, is inserted in an end-on tube, such as I have already described; this is placed in front of a spectroscope, so that a spectroscopic record of the luminosity may be obtained. The tube is at the same time connected with a Sprengel pump, in order to obtain a vacuum; it is supplied with poles, and thus an electric current may be sent through it. Supposing that such bodies as meteorites exist in free space, we must understand that they are situated practically in a vacuum, so that it is perfectly fair to begin the laboratory work by getting a vacuum as nearly as possible. The next thing to do is to try the effect of the lowest temperature, and for that purpose the central part of the tube containing the little fragments is heated by a Bunsen burner.

If any effect is produced by this application of heat it will, after some little time, be evidenced by the formation of a spectrum or by some change in the pre-existing one. What has been found is that there is scarcely any meteorite which can be examined in this way which does not give off a sufficient quantity of hydrogen to allow the hydrogen spectrum, when a feeble electric current is made to travel along the tube, to be very beautifully visible.

If the temperature of the meteoritic particles be kept sufficiently low, we see practically the spectrum of hydrogen alone. This is a demonstration of the very well-known fact that, with those bodies generally acknowledged to enter into the composition of meteorites, hydrogen is always associated.

If under similar conditions the temperature is increased, the spectrum of carbon begins to be visible, indicating that, associated with the hydrogen, there is some compound (or compounds) of carbon in the meteorite which requires a higher temperature to bring it out, but which is displayed when that higher temperature is employed. The carbonaceous structure of some meteorites has already been determined on other grounds.

If we carry the heating a little further still, and, instead of leaving the particles relatively cold and dark while the current is passing, we apply a higher temperature outside the tube by means of the Bunsen burner, then we get the luminous vapours of some constituents of the meteorite added to the spectra of hydrogen and carbon.

What luminous vapours do we get first, and which last? The experiment is a very interesting one, and may certainly be carried on in a tube such as that described until a pretty considerable development of the spectrum is obtained. When particles of a meteorite are treated in this way the first substance which, after the hydrogen and carbon, makes itself obviously visible is magnesium derived from the olivine, that substance which exists in the greatest quantity in the stones, and in the schreibersite which exists in the irons.

The representative of magnesium in this case is generally the fluting, or the remnant of the fluting, at wave-length 500 (see Fig. 4), which is seen so brilliantly when magnesium ribbon is burned in the Bunsen. Usually only the brightest part of the fluting is seen, and it then appears as a line.

The line at 500 is constantly, and another line at 495 is occasionally, seen. This line is less refrangible than the structure line of hydrogen in this region, which occupies nearly the same position as a barium line, at 493; if the heating be continued, especially in the case of stony meteorites, it is soon succeeded by a much more brilliant green glow, in which magnesium _b_ and many other lines appear, accompanied by the carbon flutings.

_Spectra of Meteorites in the Oxy-Coal-Gas Flame._

From such a method of research as the above we can pass to one in which, by means of the oxy-coal-gas flame, the spectrum of any vapour given off, provided any vapour _is_ given off at a still higher temperature, can be observed. Many meteorites have been examined in this way, and the main result is that, in the case of an "iron," the first substance to make its appearance is manganese, and the next substance to become obvious is iron.

[Fig. 9a. --- Arrangement of Apparatus for observing the Oxy-Coal-Gas Flame Spectra of Meteorites.]()

Here a very important remark must be made. The substance which will give us the predominant spectrum at lowest temperature must be that substance the volatility of which, at that temperature, is greatest. If, however complicated the chemical constitution of one of these meteorites may be, there is one substance which volatilises out of it more readily than another at a low temperature, that substance will be the first to give us its characteristic spectrum at that temperature --- and in fact we may get the spectrum of that substance alone, although its percentage in the meteorite may be extremely small. It is therefore an important result to find that, in meteorites in which the quantity of iron is very considerable, it is always the manganese that makes itself visible first, because its volatility is greater than that of iron. The point to bear in mind is that when we pass to the temperature of the oxy-coal-gas flame we get predominant evidence of the existence of manganese, and afterwards of iron.

The observations gave in all only about ten or a dozen lines belonging to the metals magnesium, iron, sodium, lithium and potassium, and two flutings, one of manganese and one of iron.

Many diagrams of such observations of the oxy-coal-gas flame-spectrum of meteorites and of olivine have been constructed, and not only the spectra of the flame but also of the "glow," --- glow being the name given to the luminosity produced in the tube under the conditions stated. There are some points of similarity, and other points of difference. One of the results which is most constant is the appearance of the line at 500; this seems to run through all the observations until we come to deal with such meteorites as the Limerick and Nejed. On the other hand, some lines and flutings do not make their appearance generally.

_Spectra of Meteorites in the Electric Arc._

If we wish to extend our inquiry into the action of a still higher temperature we can use the electric arc; that also has been done. For this purpose specimens of iron meteorites have been cut into poles, the spectra of which have been observed and photographed, so that the vapours produced have been the vapours of the pure iron meteorites; had a small portion of a meteorite been placed on an impure carbon pole, the impurities of the carbon would have been observed and photographed with the pure vapours of the meteorites. In addition to this method --- in the case of the stony meteorites --- the lower pole, after its spectrum has been well studied, has been utilised in this way; the upper pole remaining constant as an iron pole, pretty large particles of various stony meteorites have been inserted into the lower pole, and the added result carefully recorded. Further, composite photographs of the spectra of many meteorites have been obtained. Half a dozen different stony meteorites were successively rendered incandescent by their insertion into the lower pole during the exposure of a single photographic plate.

It is obvious that if we can get detailed information on such points as these, and provided there are meteorites in space of the temperatures at which we are able to determine their spectra in the laboratory, such data should be of extreme value, for at present we know of no reason why the spectra should differ according to locality.

The method of work with an electric arc is to place the lamp with its poles in the line of the collimator of the spectroscope at a distance of 2 or 3 feet from the slit, an image of the poles being formed on the slit by a lens. It is convenient to place the collimator in a north and south line, so that a siderostat can be employed to send a beam of sunlight through the slit at any hour of the day. The siderostat is an arrangement by means of which a mirror is driven by clockwork in such a way that it reflects light from the sun in a constant direction, notwithstanding the apparent motion of that body. The beam being reflected through the collimator, another lens is placed in its path so as to form an image of the sun between the poles of the lamp. The light from the sun and that from the arc thus enter the spectroscope under exactly the same conditions, and both spectra will be brought to the same focus.

At this temperature there are so many lines visible that it is most satisfactory to register them by photography. An ordinary photographic plate is only sensitive to blue light, but recent investigations have resulted in making it quite easy to photograph the green and yellow parts of the spectrum, and even the red with a little more trouble. I am indebted to Professor O. T. Sherman, of Yale College, for a formula which has suited this purpose admirably. By the use of these plates, photographs extending from a little below K to D have been obtained, the complete length of the spectrum, which was taken in three stages, being about 15 inches.

A photograph of the spectrum of the Obernkirchen meteorite, taken in this way, shows no less than 378 lines, of which 348 are due to iron. This latter fact is ascertained from a comparison of the spectrum of the meteorite with that of very pure iron, which was kindly supplied to me by Professor Roberts-Austen, of the Royal Mint, taken under exactly the same conditions. Besides the iron lines, the photograph also shows 16 lines of nickel, 3 of chromium, 1 of cobalt, 4 of manganese, 2 of titanium, and four unknown lines. It is also worth noting that this particular meteorite shows practically no sodium, although the nickel line, between the two D lines, is pretty bright.

[Fig. 10. --- Arrangement of Apparatus for observing the Spark Spectra of Meteorites.]()

_Spectra of Meteorites in Quantity Spark without Jar._

A still higher temperature may be obtained by using an electric spark. But in order that we may pass, by small stages, from low to high temperatures, we must begin the spark experiments by using a coil without a Leyden jar in the circuit. Fig. 10 shows how the apparatus is arranged for an experiment of this kind. Two of the thick wires connected with the coil proceed from the battery shown in the cupboard behind, and the other two lead to a condenser beneath the table. A finer wire leads from one terminal of the coil to the discharging apparatus, while the other terminal is connected in such a manner that an air-break can be introduced. In the diagram a Leyden jar in circuit is shown; it can be thrown out of the circuit by simply lifting it from the insulated metal disc on which it rests. The outer coating of the jar is connected with one terminal of the coil, and the inner coating with the other terminal.

The sparking arrangement itself consists of two insulated pairs of forceps arranged so that the distance between them can be changed at will, and the whole system may either be raised or lowered. Two fragments of the meteorite to be examined are then placed in the forceps and the spark passed. In order that the space between the fragments may be filled with vapour, the distance between them is usually made about 1/16 or 1/8 of an inch. With a longer spark, it generally happens that the air spectrum is more prominent than the spectrum of the meteorite, especially when the jar is in circuit.

An image of the spark is formed on the slit of the spectroscope in the usual way by means of a lens mounted on an adjustable stand. The spectroscope shown in the diagram is of the form known as the direct-vision spectroscope. Unlike an ordinary spectroscope, this shows a spectrum when the source of light is in the line of sight. A system of prisms in it, made of two kinds of glass, is so arranged that deviation is corrected whilst dispersion is retained, this being possible from the fact that particular kinds of glass have a particular proportion of deviating to dispersing power.

The observations under these conditions give in all about twenty lines belonging to the metals magnesium, sodium, iron, strontium, barium, calcium, chromium, zinc, bismuth, and nickel, and four lines of unknown origin.

_Spectra of Meteorites at the Temperature of the Jar Spark._

At the temperature of the jar spark a very great number of lines is visible, and, up to the present, it has not been possible to make complete observations of meteoritic spectra under these conditions. These high temperature spectra, however, are not of so much importance to us in the present inquiry as those at low temperatures, for the reason that once we have obtained evidence of the composition of meteorites --- that is to say, of their spectroscopic composition --- we can also tell approximately what lines will be visible in the jar spark.

All the observations recorded, with the exception of a few of the preliminary ones, have been made on undoubted meteorites, fragments of which have been, in the kindest manner, placed at my disposal by the Trustees of the British Museum.

In these observations, if a line in the spectrum of a meteorite were coincident with a metallic line, with the dispersion employed, in the absence of the brightest line of that metal, the line was regarded as originating from some other substance. Thus a line was sometimes seen at 548, apparently coincident, with the dispersion employed, with the green lines of Strontium and Nickel; sometimes the brightest line of Strontium at 4607 was absent, and it was then fair to assume that the presence of 548 was due to Nickel, but in the presence of 4607 it might be due to Strontium.

_Comparisons of the foregoing Observations among themselves._

The discussions have taken, in the first instance, the form of comparisons of the different phenomena observed, and for this purpose all the observations of flutings and of bright lines have been carefully mapped, all records having been brought to a common scale.

The following are among the comparisons already dealt with:---

1\. The spectra of meteorites observed under the various conditions, chiefly considering magnesium, iron, and manganese, with the bright lines observed at low temperatures.

The main conclusions are ---

1\. That only the lowest temperature lines of Magnesium, Sodium, Iron, Chromium, Manganese, Strontium, Calcium, Barium, Potassium, Lead, Bismuth, and Nickel are seen in the meteorites under the various conditions. They are not all visible in one meteorite or under one particular condition; the details of individual observations are fully recorded in Figs. 11 and 12.

2\. That in the case of Magnesium the line most frequently seen is the remnant of the fluting at 500, while in a photograph the main ultra-violet line recorded is the one at 373, previously recorded under these conditions by Messrs. Liveing and Dewar. In the quantity spark other lines are seen, notably _b1_, _b2_, _b4_, and 521. The line at 500 was considerably brightened when the number of cells was reduced, thus showing it to be due to some molecule which can exist best at a low temperature.

3\. That in the case of Manganese the only line visible at the temperature of the Bunsen burner, 5395, is the only line seen in the meteorites, with the exception of one in the violet at 403.

4\. That the lines of iron seen in the meteorites are those which are brightest when wire gauze is burned in the flame; chief among these lines are 579, 5268, 4383, and 6024.

# Part 3. Meteorites in the Air.

## Chapter 7. Identity of Origin of Luminous Meteors and Falling Stars with Meteorites.

It is very fortunate for science that many of the meteorites so carefully preserved in our museums _have been seen to fall_. This being so we possess full accounts of the accompanying phenomena and effects.

These comprise the most vivid luminosity; visible and audible explosions, in some cases heard over thousands of square miles of country, and, at times, a long train in the sky sometimes remaining visible for hours and indicating the path of the meteor.

Now, precisely similar effects have been noted when nothing has reached the earth's surface; and in the thousands of records of the phenomena presented by luminous meteors, fire-balls, bolides, and shooting or falling stars as they have been variously called, we have the links which connect in the most complete manner the falls of actual irons and stones from heaven with the tiniest trail of a shooting or falling star, _une étoile qui file, qui file, et disparaît_.

The heavy masses fall by virtue of their substance and compactness resisting the friction of the air, the smaller bodies are at once burnt up and fill the upper regions of the earth's atmosphere with meteoritic dust.

The difference is only one of size, and on this ground I employ the word meteorite in this book to define the smallest as well as the largest masses.

As we have seen, the weights of meteorites which have actually fallen vary between many tons and a few ounces, the latter being, in all probability, fragments shattered by the explosion. In the case of some shooting-stars the actual weight involved has been estimated by Professor Herschel as low as _two grains_. In telescopic shooting-stars the weight must be very much less than this, not one out of twenty estimated by him exceeding a pound.

It may appear impossible that such atoms should produce the brilliant effects observed, but Professor Herschel has calculated that a single grain moving at the rate of 30 miles a second represents a dynamical energy of 55,675 foot-pounds. This energy is converted by the resistance of our grosser air into heat, as the motion of a projectile is converted into heat by its impact on the target;* and hence the combustion of the matter of the meteorite, and perhaps even the incandescence of the air through which it rushes with such considerable velocity. This luminosity often commences at a height of about 80 miles, and sometimes even higher, in regions where the atmosphere must be excessively rare.

*) The particles of iron in a large projectile, after impact, which is accompanied by a flash of light, are usually brought to a dark blue colour, which would correspond to about 555° F., but the momentary heat imparted is certainly greater than this.

Could these little bodies pierce our envelope as readily as do their larger kindred, the meteoritic stones and meteoritic irons, we should certainly have the advantage of placing them in our museums; but, on the other hand, the bombardment --- the _feu de ciel_ --- might be one to which the _feu d'enfer_ of all terrestrial artillery would be, in the gross total of results, as mere child's play.

But the identity of the concomitant phenomena is by no means the only line of evidence demonstrating the connection now in question.

_Proof afforded by the Spectra of Meteors and Shooting-Stars._

The spectral appearances observed with meteors, fire-balls, and shooting-stars, which explode and produce luminous effects, are entirely in harmony with those observations on the spectra of meteorites to which I have referred.

The observations, so far as they have gone, have given decided indications of magnesium, sodium, lithium, potassium, and of the carbon flutings seen in comets.

Professor Herschel and Herr Konkoly have both noticed that in the generality of cases the lines of magnesium (one of the constituents of the olivine) show themselves first in the ordinary meteor or falling star, and the beautiful green light, which is so often associated with these falling bodies, is due to the incandescence of the vapour of magnesium.

The following quotations from Konkoly and Professor Herschel are among the authorities which may be cited for the above statement:---

On 12th, 13th, and 14th August I observed a number of meteors with the spectroscope; amongst others, on the 12th, a yellow fire-ball with a fine train, which came directly from the Perseid radiant. In the head of this meteor the lines of lithium were clearly seen by the side of the sodium line. On 13th August, at 10h. 46m. 10s., I observed in the north-east a magnificent fire-ball of emerald-green colour, as bright as Jupiter, with a very slow motion. The nucleus at the first moment only showed a very bright continuous spectrum with the sodium line; but a second after I perceived the magnesium line, and I think I am not mistaken in saying those of copper also. Besides that, the spectrum showed two very faint red lines.*

*) Konkoly, _Observatory_, vol. 3. p. 157.

A few of the green "Leonid" streaks were noticed in November (1866) to be, to all appearances, monochromatic, or quite undispersed by vision through the refracting prisms; from which we may at least very probably infer (by later discoveries with the meteor-spectroscope) that the prominent green line of magnesium forms the principal constituent element of their greenish light.*

*) Professor Herschel, letter to _Nature_, vol. 24. p. 507.

Again, later on in the same letter, Professor Herschel mentions Konkoly's observation of the bright _b_ line of magnesium, in addition to the yellow sodium line, in a meteor on 26th July 1873. I again quote from Professor Herschel ---

On the morning of 13th October in the same year, Herr von Konkoly again observed with Browning's meteor-spectroscope the long-enduring streak of a large fire-ball, which was visible to the north-east of O'Gyalla. It exhibited the yellow sodium line and the green line of magnesium very finely, besides other spectral lines in the red and green. Examining these latter lines closely with a star-spectroscope attached to an equatorial telescope, Herr von Konkoly succeeded in identifying them by direct comparison with the lines in an electric Geissler-tube of marsh-gas. They were visible in the star-spectroscope for eleven minutes, after which the sodium and magnesium lines still continued to be very brightly observable through the meteor-spectroscope.*

*) Herschel, letter to _Nature_, vol. 24. p. 507. See also _Astr. Nach._, No. 2014.

Another series of observations* gives continuous spectra for the nucleus, and two trains with sodium, and a third with sodium and a predominant green band, which was doubtless _b_ of magnesium, the meteor itself being of emerald-green colour.

*) _Monthly Notices_, vol. 23. p. 575.

In cases where the temperature has been higher, the bright line spectrum of iron has been associated with the bright lines of magnesium in the spectrum of the falling star, so that the two substances which are among the chief constituents of stones and irons --- precisely the two substances which we should expect to find --- are actually those which have been observed. The two lines which Konkoly supposes to be probably due to copper will, I expect, be found to be iron lines when other observations are made of the spectra of meteors.

These spectral appearances are naturally associated with colours, and again we find that the colours of the trail, when meteorites have fallen, closely resemble those observed when no fall has been observed. Green is a tolerably common colour, especially in slow-moving fire-balls about equal to Venus in lustre. These generally leave a short trail of red sparks.

About 10 per cent of all shooting-stars show a distinct colour, the most usual being orange or red, the slow-moving ones generally being red. The larger ones, or those with the longest trails, often turn from orange to bluish-white, like burning magnesium. Sometimes the change is very sudden and startling.*

*) Corder, _Monthly Notices_, vol. 40, p. 133.

A purple or mauve tint, like that given by copper, is sometimes remarked.

_Proof afforded by Similar Velocities._

Again, the meteorites, as we have seen, enter our atmosphere with very different velocities. The same thing happens with falling stars, which on this account have been divided into three classes as follows ---

Class 1. Swift, streak-leaving meteors.  
Class 2. Slow, with trains of sparks.  
Class 3. Small, quick, short-pathed, sometimes with streaks.

It has also been determined that the luminous effect which is common to the fall of a meteorite or the appearance of a shooting-star begins at relatively different heights. In fact, we have in meteorites, large fire-balls, and shooting-stars, a progression both with regard to the height at which they become visible and the nearness to the earth at which their luminosity is extinguished.

The actual determination of these heights was commenced by two Göttingen students --- Brandes and Benzenberg --- in 1798, at the suggestion of Chladni, with the result that the upper reaches of the earth's atmosphere were found to be pierced by bodies entering it with planetary velocities.

Professors Herschel and Newton were the first to discuss the data accumulated on this subject,* while, as early as 1864, Father Secchi made use of the electric telegraph in securing simultaneous observations.* The results of these combined inquiries may be thus shown in the case of shooting-stars ---

|Beginning. Height in miles.|End. Height in miles.|Authority.

Italy, 1864|74.6|49.7|S.  
Average|72.7|51.5|

In Herschel's values fire-balls are excluded, and hence the limits are narrower.* Fire-balls often arrive within 20 miles of the earth's surface, and then the concussion is of nearly the same intensity whether stones fall or not. Denning finds the average beginning-heights of meteors generally is 76.4 miles (from 683 computed paths), and the average end-heights 50.8 miles (from 756 computed paths). The usual end-height of ordinary shooting-stars is 54 miles, and of fire-balls 30 miles.*

Such determinations as these, when the observations can be depended upon, can be made with the greatest nicety and by graphical methods. One of the earliest employed --- a description of which will give a fair idea of the investigation --- is due to Colonel Laussedat.*

*) _Comptes Rendus_, vol. 58. p. 1100, 1864.

The observations stating the path of each meteor among the stars having been obtained, a 12-inch celestial globe is "rectified" in the usual manner for the place and time. In this way we get first the azimuth and altitude of the beginning and end of each trail. This is done for every place at which the same meteor is observed.

The results are then plotted on a large scale map, on which the latitudes and longitudes of the places of observation and the distances between them can be determined. The altitudes and distances permit the heights at the intersection of the lines of sight to be at once found, and the agreement or disagreement of the observations can be noticed, thus allowing inaccurate observations to be rejected.

By utilising such observations as these, it is possible not only to determine the heights of meteors, but also to discover the special places on the earth over which they are visible, as well as the velocity with which they traverse the atmosphere. The lowest velocity determined up to the present time is something like 2 miles per second; the maximum is something like 50 miles a second; but we may say that the average rate of movement is 30 miles a second, which is about 150 times faster than a shell leaving one of our most powerful guns.

## Chapter 8. The Aurora a Phenomenon produced by the Dust of Meteors and Falling Stars.

I have already stated that Professor Newton and others have calculated that not less than 20,000,000 of meteorites, each large enough to present us with the phenomenon of a shooting-star visible to the naked eye, enter our atmosphere daily. If this be conceded, the outer parts of our atmosphere must be constantly charged with meteoritic dust, whether oxidised or not, in a state of suspension, while it is possible that the earth encounters particles finer than that which produces the phenomena of falling stars. This being so, if we can trace this dust in the air, or after it has fallen, or both --- if chemical examination shows it to be identical with that of meteorites --- we shall be supplied with another argument which can be used in support of the fact that the bodies which produce the dust are meteoritic in their origin.

It is natural to suppose that meteors in their passage through the air break into fragments; that incandescent particles of their constituents, including nickel-iron, manganese, and the various silicates, are thrown off; and that these, or the products of their combustion, eventually fall to the surface as almost impalpable dust, among which must be magnetic oxide of iron more or less completely fused. The luminous trains of falling stars are probably due to the combustion of these innumerable particles, resembling the sparks which fly from a ribbon of iron burnt in oxygen, or the particles of the same metal thrown off when striking a flint. It is known that such particles in burning take a spherical form, and are surrounded by a layer of black magnetic oxide.

How are we to trace this dust in the air? It is well known that at times the air is electrically illuminated, not only by the flashes of lightning which pass along its lower levels, but by so-called "auroral" displays in its higher reaches, and the only means open to us of determining the presence or absence of this dust in the higher regions of the air is by observations of the atmosphere containing it when it is rendered luminous by electrical discharges. It is clear that in such a case as this the spectroscope is the only chemical aid applicable, and it has long been recognised that the spectrum observed is _not_ the spectrum of the constituents of the atmosphere, as we can study it in our laboratories.

It becomes necessary, therefore, to make a thorough investigation of the spectrum of the aurora borealis from the point of view that meteoritic dust, if it exists, is likely to assert itself in any electrical excitation of the atmosphere.

It is now many years since the idea was first thrown out that the aurora was in some way connected with shooting-stars. The connection was first suggested by Olmsted in 1833.* In M. Zenger's catalogue of aurorae observed from 1800 to 1877, he shows an apparent connection between the brightest displays and the appearance of large numbers of shooting-stars. M. Denza remarked the same connection on 27th November 1872, and that he had noticed it before. Admiral Wrangel, as quoted by Humboldt, observed that in the aurorae so constantly seen on the Siberian coast, the passage of a meteor never failed to extend the luminosity to parts of the sky previously dark.

*) _Silliman's Journal_, vols. 35., 36.

In spite of these ideas, even after the chemical nature of shooting-stars was known, observers have in the main contented themselves with making comparisons of the aurora spectrum with the spectrum of air under different conditions of temperature and pressure.

It has never been possible, however, to reconcile the aurora spectrum with any known spectrum of air. Some observers are of opinion that the lines seen in the aurora coincide with air-lines, but have different intensities, and attempt to overcome this difficulty by assuming that the aurora spectrum is produced under conditions which we are unable to imitate in our laboratories.

It is necessary to state that the existing observations of aurora spectra show such great differences of wave-length for what are probably the same lines, that it is somewhat difficult to assign origins for the lines. These discrepancies occur not only in the measures made by different observers, but in those made at different periods by the same observer. Further, the individual observations are seldom recorded, but in place of them are given the means of several observations, and in some cases the means have been obtained by grouping together lines which are very far apart. At best, therefore, it is only possible to suggest the probable origin of the lines and bands seen.

_Ångström's First Observations._

The spectroscope was employed in investigating the nature of the aurora spectrum by Ångström in 1867.* He found that the light was almost perfectly monochromatic, the spectrum consisting mainly of a yellow-green line at a wave-length given by him as 5567. With a wide slit other faint bands were visible.

*) _Le Spectre Normal du Soleil_, p. 41.

The note is so short that I give it in full; translated it reads thus ---

1868. --- From the time of Franklin's memorable observations on electricity up to the present there has been such a perfect agreement between the actions of this natural force and those of frictional electricity, that it was easy to foresee that the spectrum of lightning must be the same as that produced by the ordinary electric discharge in air. The observations made by M. Kundt have perfectly proved this. The two phenomena of the aurora borealis and of terrestrial magnetism being so closely connected with each other, that the appearance of the aurora is always accompanied by disturbances of the magnetic needle, it might be supposed that the aurora borealis was only an electric flash, which is, however, not the case. During the winter of 1867-68 I was able several times to observe the spectrum of the luminous arc which borders the dark segment, and is always present in faint auroræ. Its light was almost monochromatic, and consisted of one bright line, on the left of a group of calcium lines. I determined the wave-length of the line, which was equal to λ = 5567. Beyond this line, the intensity of which is relatively great, I observed also, by increasing the width of the slit, traces of three very faint bands which extended almost to F. On one occasion only, where the luminous arc was agitated by undulations which changed its form, I saw the regions in question lighted momentarily by some faint spectral lines; but considering the lack of intensity of the rays, it may still be said that the light of the luminous arc is sensibly monochromatic.

Here is a circumstance which gives this observation on the spectrum of the aurora borealis a greater and even cosmic importance. During a week of the month of March 1867 I succeeded in observing the same spectral line in the zodiacal light, which had then an extraordinary intensity for the latitude of Upsala. At last, during a starlight night, the whole heavens being in a manner phosphorescent, I found traces of it even in the faint light emitted from all parts of the firmament. A very remarkable fact is that the line in question coincides with none of the known lines in the spectra of simple or compound gases, at least so far as I have studied them at present. It follows from what I have said that an intense aurora borealis, such as may be observed above the polar circle, will probably give a more complicated spectrum than that which I saw. Supposing that to be the fact, it may be hoped that in the future it will be possible to explain more easily the origin of the lines found and the nature of the phenomenon itself. Not being able to give this explanation at present, I propose to turn to it another time.

_Zöllner's View._

In the _Report to the Royal Saxon Academy of Sciences_, October 1871, Zöllner expressed the opinion that the temperature of the incandescent gas of the aurora must be very low. He affirmed that the spectrum does not correspond with that of any known substance, and suggests, therefore, that it may be one given by air under some peculiar condition which cannot be experimentally reproduced. (A translation of Zöllner's paper is given in the _Philosophical Magazine_, vol. 41. p. 122.)

_Vogel's Views._

Vogel also makes the same affirmation, and comes to the same conclusion as Zöllner, namely, that the spectrum of the aurora is one which cannot be artificially produced. He suggests that it may be the integrated spectrum of several layers which exists under different conditions (_Reports of the Royal Saxony Academy of Sciences_, 1871).* He points out that the characteristic line in the aurora spectrum observed by Ångström is coincident with a very faint line of nitrogen. That this line should appear in the aurora spectrum with enhanced intensity he regards as quite consistent with the known variability of gas spectra under various conditions of temperature and pressure. He also points out the possible coincidence of one of the lines with a line in the negative pole spectrum of nitrogen at wave-length 5224, of another with an oxygen line at 5189, and of another with the strong nitrogen line 5004. The red line in the spectrum he regards as having the same origin as the group of lines in the spectrum of nitrogen which extends from 6213 to 6620, and brightens towards the violet end, the change in appearance being due to the faintness of the aurora. This, however, is not likely to be the case, as the red line has been seen both bright and sharp (R. H. Proctor, "Aurora," _Encyclopaedia Britannica_).

*) A translation of Vogel's paper is given by Capron, _Auroræ_, p. 194.

In the same paper, Vogel shows the close coincidences between the aurora lines and lines in the spectrum of iron, but considers it more in accordance with probability to regard the aurora spectrum as a modification of the spectrum of atmospheric air.

_Ångström's further Observations and Conclusions._

In a later paper (_Nature_, vol. 10. p. 210), Ångström arrives at conclusions which may be thus briefly stated ---

1\. That the aurora has two different spectra, one consisting of the characteristic line, and the other of the fainter lines.

2\. That the coincidences of the bright green line with a faint line in the spectrum of air, as determined by Dr. Vogel, is purely accidental, and also that there is no coincidence of any importance with any member of the hydrocarbon group in which it falls.

3\. That the bright line is probably due to fluorescence or phosphorescence.

4\. That Vogel's theory of unknown conditions of temperature and pressure being competent to produce the change from the ordinary experimental spectrum of air to that given by the aurora is inadmissible.  (Ångström regarded the spectrum of a gas as invariable.)

5\. That moisture may be neglected in considering the nature of the aurora spectrum.

He describes an experiment on a glow equivalent to the glow of the negative pole of an air vacuum-tube, in which the spectrum obtained showed close coincidences with three faint lines in the aurora spectrum. A layer of phosphoric anhydride is spread over the bottom of a flask fitted with platinum wires; after exhaustion with an air-pump, the current from an induction coil is passed between the two platinums. The flask then becomes filled with a violet light like that which, under ordinary conditions, only appears at the negative pole. The spectrum of this light shows the following close coincidences with that of the aurora:---

Auroræ Barker|431|470.5|...  
Auroræ Vogel|...|469.4|523.3  
Auroræ Ångström|...|472.0|521.0  
Auroræ Lemström|426.2|469.4|523.5  
Means|428.6|470.3|522.6  
Violet Light|427.2|470.7|522.7 

Although this coincidence is rather striking, it must be remembered that there are other strong bands in the spectrum of the negative pole which do not appear in aurora spectra. As mapped by Hasselberg, the spectrum of the negative pole consists of a series of bright flutings shaded off towards the violet, the brightest edges of them being at wave-lengths 419.8, 423.6, 427.8, 451.5, 455.4, 459.9, 465.1, 470.8, all these are of equal intensities* (see Fig. 13).

*) _Mémoires de l'Academic Impériale des Sciences de St. Pétersburg_, Series 7., vol. 32. No. 15.

Capron remarks that "if the violet pole glow spectrum is to represent the aurora spectrum, it must be under conditions different from those by which it obtains in dry-air vacuum tubes or flasks at ordinary temperatures" (_Auroræ_, p. 126).

[Fig. 13. --- Diagram showing that the Aurora Spectrum is not a Spectrum of Nitrogen or Oxygen.]()

There can, therefore, be little doubt that the aurora spectrum has nothing in common with the negative pole spectrum of nitrogen, and that the three close coincidences noted by Ångström are merely accidental.

With regard to Ångström's remark that Vogel's theory that the aurora spectrum is a spectrum of air under unknown conditions is inadmissible, we now know that gas spectra are not so invariable as Ångström supposed; but still we have no right to assume that any particular change is possible until we can prove it experimentally, or at the very least, prove an approach to such a change. If we assume that any change may take place in any spectrum, we upset the whole basis of spectrum analysis.

_Comparison of the Aurora Spectrum with the Negative Pole Spectrum of Oxygen._

The negative pole spectrum of oxygen, as mapped by Schuster (_Phil. Trans._ Part 1., 1879), consists of four broad bands, the two brightest having the following positions:---

5205.0 Brightest part 5255  
5292.5 Brightest part 5255

5552.8 Brightest part 5586  
5629.6 Brightest part 5586

Under great dispersion, these bands break up into series of lines. The proximity of the brightest part of one band (5586) to the aurora line is notable, but considering that the aurora line is always sharp, Schuster concludes that there is no connection between the spectrum of the aurora and that of the negative pole glow of oxygen (quoted by Capron, _Auroræ_, p. 130).

_Comparison with the Spectrum of Hydrogen._

Similarly, all attempts to identify the spectrum of the aurora with that of hydrogen, another constituent of our atmosphere (in the form of water vapour), have failed. On this point Capron remarks: "No principal line and one subsidiary line only,* actually coincide with the aurora spectrum, this last being that to which Dr. Vogel assigns an identical wave-length, viz. 5189" (_Auroræ_, p. 109).

*) The subsidiary lines of hydrogen constitute what I have elsewhere described as the structure spectrum of hydrogen.

That this coincidence is of no importance is obvious when it is remembered that there are a great number of such lines in the spectrum of hydrogen, and that no experiments have been recorded indicating that this line is more persistent than the others.

_Comparison with the Spectrum of Phosphoretted Hydrogen._

Next in importance to comparisons of the aurora spectrum with air spectra is the comparison with the flame of phosphoretted hydrogen, in connection with Ångström's suggestion that the characteristic green line may be due to phosphorescence or fluorescence. The spectrum of phosphoretted hydrogen consists of several bands, the centres of the four brightest being at 526.3, 510.6, 560.5, and 599.4 (Lecoq de Boisbaudran, _Spectres Lumineux_, p. 189). These bands brighten when the flame is artificially cooled, especially the less refrangible ones.

On this subject Capron says ---

Having regard to the near proximity of the phosphoretted hydrogen band to the bright aurora line, to the circumstance of this band brightening by reduction of temperature (a phenomenon probably connected with ozone), to the peculiar brightening of one line in the green in the "aurora" and "phosphorescent" tubes (the phosphorescent tubes probably containing O), and to the observed circumstance that the electric discharge has a phosphorescent or fluorescent afterglow (isolated, I believe, by Faraday), I feel there is strong evidence in favour of such an origin to the principal aurora line, if not to the red line as well (_Auroræ_, p. 126).

But the mere fact of one of the phosphoretted hydrogen bands, and that only the third in order of brightness, falling near the characteristic aurora line cannot be supposed to be anything more than accidental, unless the absence of the two brightest bands can be explained. As this cannot be done, the suggestion may be disregarded.

The information given about the green line seen in the phosphorescent tube by Capron is sufficient for any conclusions to be arrived at.

_Groeneman's Meteoric Dust Theory._

So far we have had chiefly to deal with theories in which the aurora spectrum is regarded as being inseparable from that of atmospheric air, but we have next to consider one which, if true, would give a totally different origin.

In 1874 Groeneman (_Ast. Nach._ No. 2010) resuscitated the theory of Olmsted that the aurora has its origin in the fall of incandescent meteoric dust.* The iron particles are regarded as being competent to produce the magnetic phenomena which accompany auroræ. This theory was not received very favourably, because it left the spectroscopic phenomena as far from a solution as ever. Thus Capron remarks (_Auroræ_, p. 170) that "if auroræ were composed of incandescent glowing meteors, it would be reasonable to expect to find in the spectrum the lines of iron, a metal constituting so prominently the composition of meteorites. No connection between the iron and the aurora spectrum is, however, proved, though it may be suspected. The iron spectrum contains so many lines that some may, as a mere accidental circumstance, closely agree with the aurora lines." Yogel also considers that we are not entitled to regard the close coincidences of the aurora lines with some of the iron lines as complete evidence of iron vapour, until we have succeeded in showing by experiments that the relative intensities of the iron lines are subject to great changes, and in this way accounting for the appearance of faint lines in the aurora spectrum, or, on the other hand, for the absence of the strongest lines. I shall show subsequently what experiments have now conclusively proved the presence of iron.

*) This theory was subsequently discussed in an appendix to the _Memorie della, Societa degli Spectroscopisti Italiani_, 1878.

_Mr. Capron's Conclusions._

In reviewing the theories suggested up to 1879, to explain the origin of aurorse, Mr. Eand Capron makes the following statement: ---

As the general result of spectrum work on the aurora up to the present time, we seem to have quite failed in finding any spectrum which, as to position, intensity, and general character of lines, well coincides with that of the aurora. Indeed, we may say we do not find any spectrum so nearly allied to portions even of the aurora spectrum as to lead us to conclude that we have discovered the true nature of one spectrum of the aurora (supposing it to comprise, as some consider, two or more). The whole subject may be characterised as still a scientific mystery (_Auroræ_, p. 171).

_Lemström's Observations._

The next contribution to our knowledge of aurora spectra of any importance is that of Lemström's (_L'Aurore Boréale_, 1886). All previous observers who attempted to identify the spectrum of the aurora with that of atmospheric air failed to do so, but Lemström asserts (p. 158) that the twelve lines which have been recorded in aurora spectra are nearly all seen in the spectrum of a Geissler-tube containing the same gases as those constituting our atmosphere. The differences in the relative intensities he believes to be due to conditions of temperature and pressure.* Although the auroral line (wave-length 557) does not agree perfectly with the line at 558 seen in the spectrum given by his _appareil de l'aurore boréale_ (air vacuum-tubes illuminated by sparks from a Holtz machine), he regards the atmospheric origin of the aurora spectrum as completely demonstrated. He states (p. 138) that the characteristic line of the aurora spectrum is always seen in the light produced by the discharge of an electric current (by means of his _appareil d'écoulement_) from the top of a mountain. He gives a table of auroral lines compared with the lines in the spectra of rarefied air, as observed by himself, and by Vogel and Sundell under other conditions. The air lines recorded by Vogel nearly all coincide with lines recorded as oxygen lines by Schuster (_Phil. Trans._ Part 1. 1879); but it is important to note that some of the strongest lines mapped by Schuster are absent from Vogel's list (see Fig. 13). So that, even if we allow that some of the aurora lines fall near lines of oxygen, the absence of the brightest oxygen lines from the spectrum is sufficient evidence for us to safely conclude that we are not dealing with the line spectrum of oxygen. We have previously seen that it is not the negative pole spectrum of oxygen.

*) "Si l'on se demande pourquoi on ne voit point dans l'aurore polaire toutes les raies existant dans ces gaz, l'experience répond que les raies des gaz changent selon la température et la pression de ces gaz" (_L'Aurore Boréale_, p. 158).

In the same table (_L'Aurore Boréale_, p. 92), the aurora lines are compared with some of the lines or bands observed in the spectrum of rarefied air by Lemström. The air lines which he gives all agree in position with some of the nitrogen flutings mapped by Hasselberg (_Mémoires de l'Académie Impériale de St. Pétersbourg_, Series 7., vol. 32., No. 15). One of them is at wave-length 558, and this he believes to be coincident with the aurora line 557. The intensity of the line is not given, but Hasselberg gives it as a comparatively feeble fluting at 557 (see Fig. 13). Considering the absence of the brightest nitrogen flutings from the spectrum of the aurora, the supposed coincidences between some of Lemström's rarefied air lines and lines in the aurora spectrum, which are far from perfection, may be disregarded.

The same objections apply to the lines in the rarefied air spectrum which have been recorded by Sundell; those which fall anywhere near lines in the aurora are comparatively faint flutings or lines in the spectrum of nitrogen; at all events, flutings of the same or greater intensities are absent, and there is no evidence to show that the coincident ones retain their brightness as the others fade.

Lemström thus leaves the origin of the aurora spectrum as uncertain as ever. There is no evidence to show that it is a spectrum of air, or, indeed, of any other gas. If it be a spectrum of air, it is one which has never been obtained experimentally, and one which can only be put forward by making unphilosophical assumptions and carefully avoiding experiments.

_Gyllenskiöld's Observations and Conclusions._

Still later observations of the aurora which have been published are those made at Cape Thorsden by M. Carlheim-Gyllenskiöld.* Two lists of lines are given, one from observations made with a Hofmann spectroscope, and the other from observations made with a Wrede spectroscope. The lines in the first list extend from blue to red, and those in the second list from green to violet. The individual observations of different aurorse with the lines observed in each are given. 36 auroræ are recorded in which only 1 line was visible, 15 in which there were only 2 lines, 6 with 3 lines, 15 with 4 lines, 5 with 6 lines, 4 with 7 lines, 1 with 8, 1 with 9, and 1 with 10 lines, so that altogether no less than 84 observations are recorded.

*) _Observations faites au Cap Thorsden, Spitzberg, par V Expédition Suédoise_, vol. 2. p. 1. _Aurora Borealis_, par Carlheim-Gyllenskiöld.

The total number of lines seen was 32.  Gyllenskiöld's main conclusions are ---

1\. That 16 of the aurora lines nearly coincide with air lines, 8 with the positive pole spectrum of nitrogen, 4 with the negative pole spectrum of nitrogen, and 3 with lines of hydrogen.

2\. That the aurora spectrum greatly resembles that of lightning, and he regards it as consisting of several superposed spectra.  The variable character of the spectrum is accounted for by the absence sometimes of one, sometimes of another, of these elementary spectra.

3\. That the brightness of the aurora does not depend upon the energy of the electrical discharge which produces it, but upon some cause with which we are not acquainted.

4\. Two kinds of auroræ are distinguished, --- red and yellow. In the former, the positive pole spectrum of nitrogen is predominant, while in the latter the negative pole spectrum is predominant. Laboratory experiments have shown that the positive pole spectrum of nitrogen is given by dense moist air, while the negative pole spectrum is given by rarefied dry air; and Gyllenskiöld suggests that the yellow auroræ are formed in the higher parts of the atmosphere, and the red ones in the lower layers.

5\. That the observations bear out Ångström's suggestion that some of the bands belong to the negative pole spectrum of nitrogen. He says: "Nos observations confirment done l'opinion d'Ångström, que les bandes faiblement lumineuses de l'aurore boréale appartiennent au spectre du pôle negatif; auxquelles les bandes et les lignes de l'azote se joignent dans certains cas." He observes that the characteristic line of the aurora appears in company with the negative pole spectrum, and says it is probable that some of the more refrangible bands of the positive pole spectrum also appear at the same time. Both the positive and negative pole spectra are very rich in violet and ultra-violet rays, and Gyllenskiöld's observations support Ångström's view, that the characteristic line is due to the fluorescence of oxygen produced by the violet light of the negative pole.

This fluorescence, however, cannot be reproduced in experiments with Geissler-tubes, and M. Gyllenskiöld concludes that the origin of the characteristic line still remains unexplained, but he suggests that its origin may eventually be discovered by investigation of the fluorescent spectra of various chemical substances.

The characteristic aurora line therefore remains unexplained by M. Gyllenskiöld. As regards the remaining lines, he states that sixteen nearly coincide with air lines, but it is important to note that these are not the sixteen strongest air lines. Some of the lines fall near to bands in the positive pole spectrum of nitrogen, as Gyllenskiöld points out; but equally strong or stronger bands are not seen in the aurora, so that the coincidences are only accidental. The same applies to the bands in the negative pole spectrum.

Like Lemström, then, Gyllenskiöld makes no advance as regards the origin of the spectrum of the aurora, but at the same time it is only fair to acknowledge the value of the observations. With regard to the third conclusion, my work suggestst hat the brightness of the aurora may depend upon the varying quantities of meteoritic dust in the atmosphere at different times.

I have next to refer to my own observations and comparisons.

## Chapter 9. Some Experiments and a further Discussion.

In order to demonstrate that the aurora spectrum does not coincide with the vacuum-tube spectrum of air, I have made a series of observations of an end-on air vacuum-tube, about 5 feet long and 2 inches in diameter. The tube was arranged as in Fig. 14, one end being connected with the Sprengel punip, and the other with a piece of glass tube, by means of mercury joints. The latter tube was connected with a hand air-pump to save time in exhausting. After partial exhaustion the tube was sealed off with a blowpipe, and the exhaustion completed with the Sprengel. The slit of the spectroscope was placed close to the bulb at the end of the tube (Fig. 14). The diagram also shows a Geissler-tube arranged for comparison.

When the spark first passed only a few of the strongest nitrogen flutings in the violet were visible, but as the pressure was reduced, the spectrum gradually extended towards the red. A line of oxygen at 5320 was visible in the early stages, but it afterwards disappeared. At the most luminous stage, nothing but nitrogen flutings were visible. After a time these flutings became dim, and low temperature flutings of carbon appeared. Then the F line of hydrogen appeared, and a little later the C line. Later still, the hydrogen line at G also appeared. With the further dimming of the nitrogen flutings, an oxygen line at 471 brightened, being sometimes as bright as the F line, and brighter than the carbon flutings. The whole spectrum then became very faint, but as the line at 471 dimmed, another oxygen line at 465 appeared.  Ultimately, the glow was so faint that only a few of the nitrogen flutings were visible.

The sequence of the various flutings and lines is shown in Fig. 15. Below the various air spectra the principal lines of the aurora spectrum are given for comparison. It will be seen at a glance that there are no coincidences with the most persistent flutings, which are all that need be considered.

[Fig. 14. --- Large end-on Vacuum-Tube, arranged for an Observation of the Spectrum of Air at varying Pressures.]()

Excluding for the present Gyllenskiöld's observations, the general results arrived at may now be tabulated. I should add that since I communicated to the Royal Society in 1888 some of the results embodied in the table, a further inquiry has suggested that the lines F and G of hydrogen (λ 486 and 434) have been really seen, as well as those of the substances indicated in the map given in Fig. 16.

The chemical substances indicated, it will be seen, are precisely those constituents of meteorites which are volatilised at the lowest temperatures, namely, manganese, magnesium, and lead. Besides these there are probably hydrogen and hydrocarbon, besides possibly other compounds of carbon which, when rendered incandescent, give the carbon flutings.

In discussing the meteoritic dust theory, as first enunciated by Olmstead during the display of 1833, spectroscopists lost sight of the importance of considering the volatility of the meteoritic constituents, instead of their quantities. Iron exists in great quantity in meteorites, and was naturally the first thing to be expected in the aurora spectrum, supposing it to be a meteoritic phenomenon. But, as I have already pointed out (p. 50), experiments on the luminous phenomena seen at low temperatures show that if magnesium, manganese, and lead are present in meteorites, they will be indicated in the spectrum before the iron.

The aurora being a low temperature phenomenon, we should indeed expect to find in its spectrum lines and remnants of flutings seen in the spectra of meteorites at low temperatures if its origin were in any way meteoritic.

The characteristic line of the aurora is very probably the remnant of the brightest manganese fluting at 558.* Ångström gave the wave-length of the line as 5567, and since then many observers have given the same wave-length for it, but probably without making independent determinations. Piazzi Smyth, however, gives it as 558, which agrees exactly with the bright edge of the manganese fluting. R. H. Proctor also gives the line as less refrangible than Ångström does. He says: "My own measures give me a wave-length very slightly greater than those of Winlock and Ångström.*

*) While this book is passing through the press, Dr. Huggins has called this suggestion in question.

*) _Nature_, vol. 3. p. 468.

 Gyllenskiöld's measures with the Wrede spectroscope also give 5580 as the wave-length of the characteristic line. I feel justified, therefore, in disregarding the difference between the wave-length of the edge of the manganese fluting and the generally accepted wave-length of the aurora line.

The line of manganese at 540, which is seen also with the flutings, has been recorded in the aurora by Vogel.

The remnants of the two magnesium flutings at wave-lengths 500 and 521 are also seen as lines in the aurora. In addition to these, there is sometimes the lead fluting at 546, and probably also the green, line of thallium at 535, as indicated in the tables.

Four lines in the aurora spectrum are probably due to carbon. The first is at 516.5, the brightest fluting seen in the spectrum of a Bunsen burner; I have previously described this as a high-temperature fluting, but the term is only relative. The second is the low-temperature fluting at 483, which has been recorded by several observers. There is probably also the high-temperature carbon group beginning at 474, the maximum light of which is about 469. Vogel records it as a band extending from 463 to 469, and Lemström as 469 to 471. These observations, therefore, justify us in regarding this as a band, and if we take the readings of the other observers as the wave-lengths of the part of maximum brightness, we get the mean reading of the maximum as 467.5. This agrees as well as can be expected with the true wave-length of the maximum, 468. The hydrocarbon fluting at 431 has probably also been seen.

Fig. 16 shows how the aurora spectrum can be built up from the lowest temperature spectra of manganese, magnesium, lead, and thallium, and the brightest flutings of carbon. When the temperature is increased iron (615) sometimes flashes in.

_Further Discussion of Gyllenskiöld's Observations._

If, in discussing Gyllenskiöld's observations, we limit ourselves to those cases in which not more than four lines were recorded, we find that with a few exceptions, the lines seen were lines which are brightest in the spectra of meteorites at low temperatures. It might at first sight be expected that when only a few lines are seen, they ought to be the same in every case. There are variations, however, which in all probability are due to differences in composition of different groups of meteorites.

The following tables contain all the observations in which not more than four lines were recorded. The probable origin of each line is also stated.  Some of the lines have been arranged in different columns, as the discussion has suggested.

[Fig. 16. --- Map showing probable Origin of the Spectrum of the Aurora.]()

[TABLE]

[TABLE]

It will be observed that the characteristic line was seen alone eight times by Gyllenskiöld out of the thirty-eight observations recorded in the first table.

Out of the total number of seventy-six observations in the tables, the line of manganese at wave-length 540, which is seen in the spectra of many of the "bright line stars," was seen alone on two occasions, and six times in company with other lines.

The first fluting of lead, at wave-length 546, occurs alone three times, is twice associated with the thallium line, and occurs six times along with other lines.

The remnant of the magnesium fluting at 500 occurs alone only once, but that at 521 occurs alone six times.

The first fluting of carbon, at 517, occurs alone three times, and twice in company with other lines. The carbon band extending from 468 to 474 occurs alone four times, and six times with other lines. The low temperature fluting of carbon at 483 only occurs once, and is then alone. The first iron line at 579 occurs alone twice, and six times along with other lines. When we get iron apparently without manganese 558 it is probably due to masking of 558 by continuous spectrum. The green line of iron at 527 occurs alone seven times, and thirteen times in company with other lines.

The thallium line appears alone only once, but in company with other lines it appears fifteen times.

There are only six lines for which no origins can at present be suggested. The discrepancies between the readings of the same lines at different times are so great that a few outstanding lines are only to be expected.

It now remains for future observers to determine by direct comparisons whether the coincidences suggested are real, or merely accidental approximations.

_The Norwegian Observations._

The Report of the Norwegian Polar Station at Bossekop in Alten, in connection with the International Polar Investigation (1882-1883), gives the results of a few interesting observations of the aurora spectrum. Herr Krafft states that in general only the characteristic aurora line (558) is seen, even in strong auroræ. The red line occasionally appears very conspicuously, but only in flashes.

The wave-lengths obtained for the aurora line were 5595, 5586, and 5587. Unlike most observations, these place the aurora line on the less refrangible side of the manganese fluting. Hence, we have an additional reason for neglecting the difference between the wave-length of the brightest edge of the manganese fluting, and the commonly accepted wave-length of the aurora line, as given by Ångström.

On account of the rapid flashing-up and disappearance of the red line only one measurement could be made, and the wavelength obtained was 6205. If this reading be reduced in the same proportion as those of the green line, a wave-length is obtained which agrees almost perfectly with that of the brightest edge of the iron fluting.*

*) These observations were not available to me before the preceding maps, Figs. 15, 16, were made, so that the iron line has been omitted from them.

These observations are the latest which have been published, and were obviously made with a full knowledge of all previous work, so that their importance must be strongly insisted upon.

It is fair to assume that the red line is due to iron, because we know that the effect of a slight increase in the intensity of the discharge which produces an aurora in which only the manganese fluting is visible would be to bring out the iron vapour. Hence in an aurora in which the green line is constant, and the red line is only intermittently visible, there must be a discharge in which there are sudden fluctuations in intensity, and a simple cause of the reddening of the aurora is now before us.

_The Spectrum of Lightning._

If the origin of the auroral spectrum is really that which I have assigned to it, in lightning in which the electric action is feeble we ought to again meet with some of the lines indicating higher temperatures.

Dr. Schuster made a series of observations on the spectrum of lightning in Colorado in 1878. The region of the spectrum dealt with extended from wave-length 500 to 580, and the following lines were observed:---

559.2  
533.4  
518.2  
516.0 

There can be little doubt that the first line on the list is the remnant of the manganese fluting at 558, the same as seen in auroræ. The second is in all probability the thallium line at wave-length 535, the third is probably _b_ (518.3), and the fourth the edge of the carbon fluting at 516.

The lines at 559.2 and 516 were only seen on one occasion.

These observations are of very great importance, inasmuch as they appear to indicate that the difference between the spectrum of feeble or diffused lightning and the spectrum of aurora is due to a difference of temperature only.

Not only can we thus trace the difference in the spectrum as we pass from aurora to lightning, but just as we can trace the effects of gradually increasing temperatures on the spectrum of the aurora, we can trace the changes due to variations in the intensities of lightning discharges, as I shall now proceed to indicate.

The spectrum of lightning as observed by Schuster in Colorado was obviously one produced by a comparatively feeble discharge. It differs from what may be conveniently called a "high temperature aurora" only in having the magnesium fluting at 500 replaced by _b_. It is important to note, however, that the difference in the number of lines often seen in auroræ and in lightning is in all probability due to the instantaneous character of the latter.

As we pass to the spectrum of such a discharge as Vogel observed in September 1871, the 500 line of nitrogen makes its appearance, and the manganese fluting at 558 disappears. Vogel's complete list of lines is as follows (Poggendorff's _Annalen der Physik_, band 143. p. 654) ---

534.1  
518.4  
500.2  
486.0  
467.3, broad band  
to 458.3

The band seen by Yogel in the blue was in all probability the carbon band; this is the most visible of the carbon bands in consequence of the absence of continuous spectrum in the blue.

The last stage in the spectrum of lightning seems to be that in which the brightest lines in the spectrum consist entirely of lines of nitrogen. Such a spectrum has been observed by Colonel John Herschel, the following lines being recorded:---

569.7  
500.9  
463.6 

These are the three strongest lines of nitrogen, the wave-lengths of which, according to Thalén, are ---

567.8 double line  
566.6 double line  

500.5 double line  
500.2 double line  

463.1 

We have, therefore, an almost complete sequence of electrical discharges through our atmosphere, from discharges so feeble that we only see the 500 fluting of magnesium, or the first fluting of manganese in their spectra, to those in which the brightest lines of nitrogen, characteristic of intense discharges, are the brightest lines visible.

In experiments with large air vacuum tubes the _lines_ of nitrogen are never seen, and it is extremely improbable, therefore, that they would occur in weak discharges through a space which is much less confined. Hence, when the line at 500 is seen in conjunction with the fluting of manganese, it is in all probability due to magnesium and not to nitrogen.

The forked lightning discharge can be imitated by a jar spark, or by the spark from an electrical machine, and the brightest lines in the spectra, as we have seen, are identical.

[Fig. 17. --- Map showing the Sequence of Spectra in Electrical Discharges of gradually increasing Intensities through the Atmosphere, the feebler Discharges taking place in the rarefied Regions impregnated with Meteoritic Dust. (The thick white horizontal line indicates that no observations were made in that region.)]()

Fig. 17 shows the various spectra of air charged with meteoritic dust when illuminated by electrical discharges of gradually increasing intensities. The lowest temperature of all gives the Mn fluting at 558. With the first increase in intensity the iron fluting (615) is at times momentarily added, then magnesium, lead, thallium, and carbon until there is a complete spectrum. The next stage of increasing intensity is that observed by Schuster, in which magnesium is represented by _b_. Then comes Vogel's spectrum, entirely without manganese, but with _b_, Thallium (535), Hydrogen (F, 486), Carbon band (468-474), and Nitrogen (500). Schuster did not make observations beyond 500, so that the continuity in that region is apparently broken.

It is possible that the broad band in the blue observed by Vogel was the group of nitrogen lines, the brightest of which is at 463; but in that case it is difficult to understand why a decided maximum was not recorded. Finally, we have the spectrum observed by Colonel Herschel, in which those nitrogen lines appear brighter than all the rest, exactly as they appear in an intense spark discharge in our laboratories.

I think it will be granted that, after what has preceded, there is strong evidence of an intimate relation between the spectrum of the aurora and the spectra of meteorites, which leads to the conclusion that the upper reaches of the atmosphere contain particles of magnesium, manganese, iron, and carbon.

The natural origin is the dust of those bodies which are continually entering those regions, and hence the proof afforded by the spectroscopic observation of shooting-stars, that they are identical in chemical composition with meteorites, is strengthened by these auroral observations; while, on the other hand, the origin of the auroral spectrum receives a new explanation. Certainly the coincidence is such as to justify us in regarding meteoritic dust as the origin of the spectrum until a better and more probable origin is demonstrated.

How this view will meet the periodicity and geographical distribution of auroræ remains to be investigated; the question may be asked whether the earth sometimes meets greater quantities of aurora-producing matter revolving round the sun than at other times, and whether the periodicity may be explained in this way.

_The Aurora and the Zodiacal Light._

Since the shooting-star ignition level lies between 75 and 50 miles in height, and auroræ have been seen at heights of over 100 miles, it seems probable that the matter which reaches the earth from space is in the main of three degrees of fineness, and gives evidences of its existence at three different heights. The finest furnishes materials for auroral displays at heights reaching to 130 miles,* the mean fineness ignites at a height of 75 miles, and gives rise to the appearance of falling stars, till a height of 50 miles is reached, when it is all consumed; the coarsest of all at times reaches the surface itself as meteoritic irons or stones.

*) Capron and Herschel, "On the Auroral Beam of November 17, 1882" (_Phil. Mag._, May 1883). Professor Herschel, from measurements made 1863-1867, determined the height of long white stationary auroral arches to be close upon 100 miles.  Herr Sophas Trimholt (_Nature_, vol. 27. p. 290) gives 90 miles, and Baron Nordenskjöld (_Scientific Work of the "Vega" Expedition_, Part 1. pp. 401-450) gives 115 miles. Professor Herschel has also referred me to measurements of auroral arches by Dr. Dalton (_Phil. Trans._, 1828, p. 291), who found 100 miles.

An additional argument in favour of the meteoritic theory of the aurora is furnished by other phenomena, which sometimes accompany it.

During the great aurora of January 1831 (Poggendorff's _Annalen_ of that year) a bright yellow streak was seen to rise with common cloud velocity, forming an arch from west to east, becoming invisible in the west by the time it had reached the east. During the same aurora Professor Bischoff, in Burgboohl, saw a moving cloud, as bright as the Milky Way, pass from east to west in five minutes.

During another aurora, December 1870, Professor Rudberg, of Upsala, saw a very bright patch, of double the dimensions of the moon's disk, moving with great velocity behind the auroral beams.

On 2d November 1871 Dr. Groneman saw a strange, feather-like, brilliant arch, striped parallel to its well-defined sides, and changing its curve during its visibility of two hours' duration. Dr. Vogel determined the auroral character of its spectrum.

On 17th May 1875 Mr. Lefroy (Freemantle, Western Australia) describes a similar feather-like appearance, which he considered to be converging streams of infinitely minute particles of matter passing through space at a distance from the earth less than that of the moon, at which the earth's aerial envelope may still have a density sufficient, by its resistance, to give to cosmic dust passing through it with planetary velocity that slight illumination which it possesses.*

*) _Nature_, vol. 12. p. 330.

On 17th November 1882, however, was seen the most remarkable display of this nature in the middle of an intense aurora then visible. Again the appearance was feather-like, again the spectra were auroral, but the strange object moved across the sky, at a height of 133 miles, as determined by Capron and Herschel, and with a planetary velocity of between 10 and 15 miles a second!

Dr. Groneman did not hesitate at the time to look upon it as a mass of meteoritic dust traversing the higher reaches of our air, and regarded it as a strong confirmation of the view which he had resuscitated,* --- a conclusion in which I concur.

*) _Ibid._ vol. 27. p. 296.

The above results also strengthen the view that the aurora is very similar in some respects to the zodiacal light. Such a connection is indicated by the fact that when we have the greatest number of auroræ, in spring and autumn, the zodiacal light is also best visible. The spectroscopic observations of Ångström and Respighi show that the spectrum of the zodiacal light consists of the characteristic line of the aurora and a short continuous spectrum, and they thus furnish further evidence of the connection suggested. The observations of Wright and others, showing that the spectrum is continuous, are not at variance with Ångström's observation, for we should expect the spectrum to be somewhat variable. It is probable that the observations showing nothing but continuous spectrum were made when the temperature was only sufficient to render the meteoritic particles red-hot. That the zodiacal light does consist of solid particles, or at all events of particles capable of reflecting light, is shown by the polariscope.

No one has ever gone so far as to suggest that the zodiacal light is an atmospheric phenomenon, and yet the principal line in its spectrum is generally accepted as being identical with that in the spectrum of the aurora. We have, therefore, an additional reason, if one be required, for discarding any atmospheric origin which has been suggested for the auroral spectrum.

## Chapter 10. Traces of Meteoritic Dust in the Deep Oceans.

We have now complete evidence of the existence of meteoritic dust in the atmosphere, first, from the known number of meteorites which enter the atmosphere, and secondly, from the spectroscopic observations of auroræ. This dust will finally reach the earth's surface, and it is exceedingly interesting to trace its subsequent history as far as possible.

It is universally recognised that the atmosphere holds in suspension an immense number of very minute particles of organic and inorganic origin. These latter must be either dust taken up by aerial currents from the ground, or the result of volcanic action, or extra-terrestrial bodies. Many scientific men, among whom we may mention Ehrenberg, Daubrée, Reichenbach, Nordenskjöld, Tissandier, Murray, and Rénard, have studied this problem. Dust collected in various places at different times has been examined with a view of determining whether its origin were meteoritic. In many cases, in which chiefly definite iron chondroi have been observed, the evidence has seemed very strong in favour of the view. The detection of such dust, which falls on the general surface of the earth, is almost hopeless, and that which is collected on snow in inhabited countries containing foundries and the like is doubtful, but that which falls on the sea will have a chance of accumulating where the water is quietest. The researches of Messrs. Murray and Rénard during the _Challenger_ Expedition seem to indicate that such an accumulation really takes place. These investigators,* in giving the results of their researches, point out that at the greatest depths of the ocean farthest from land the sea bottom is very different from that nearer the coastlines.

*) "On the Microscopic Characters of Volcanic Ashes and Cosmic Dust, and their Distribution in Deep-sea Deposits," _Proc. R. S. E._, and _Nature_, vol. 29. p. 585.

Under these necessary conditions of exceedingly slow deposition and absence of ordinary sources of contamination, it is clear that the problem can be attacked under the best conditions.

We read ---

The considerable distance from land at which we find cosmic particles in greatest abundance in deep-sea deposits, eliminates at once objections which might be raised with respect to metallic particles found in the neighbourhood of inhabited countries. On the other hand, the form and character of the spherules of extra-terrestrial origin are essentially different from those collected near manufacturing centres. These magnetic spherules have never elongated necks or a cracked surface, like those derived from furnaces, with which we have carefully compared them. Neither are the magnetic spherules with a metallic centre comparable either in their form or structure to those particles of native iron which have been described in the eruptive rocks, especially in the basaltic rocks of the north of Ireland, of Iceland, _etc._

[Fig. 18. --- Section of Ocean showing Red Clays at Depths of 3000 Fathoms (18,000 feet).]()

Messrs. Murray and Rénard then state on what they rely in support of their view that many of the particles thus obtained from great depths are of cosmic origin ---

If we plunge a magnet into an oceanic deposit, especially a red clay from the central parts of the Pacific, we extract particles, some of which are magnetite from volcanic rocks, and to which vitreous matters are often attached; others again are quite isolated, and differ in most of their properties from the former. The latter are generally round, measuring hardly 0.2 mm.; generally they are smaller, their surface is quite covered with a brilliant black coating, having all the properties of magnetic oxide of iron; often there may be noticed upon them cup-like depressions clearly marked. If we break down these spherules in an agate mortar, the brilliant black coating easily falls away, and reveals white or gray metallic malleable nuclei, which may be beaten out by the pestle into thin lamellae This metallic centre, when treated with an acidulated solution of sulphate of copper, immediately assumes a coppery coat, thus showing that it consists of native iron. But there are some malleable metallic nuclei extracted from the spherules which do not give this reaction --- they do not take the copper coating. Chemical reaction shows that they contain cobalt and nickel; very probably they constitute an alloy of iron and these two metals, such as is often found in meteorites, and whose presence in large quantities hinders the production of the coppery coating on the iron. G. Rose has shown that this coating of black oxide of iron is found on the periphery of meteorites of native iron, and its presence is readily understood when we admit their cosmic origin. Indeed these meteoric particles of native iron, in their transit through the air, must undergo combustion, and, like small portions of iron from a smith's anvil, be transformed either entirely or at the surface only into magnetic oxide, and in this latter case the nucleus is protected from further oxidation by the coating which thus covers it.

[Fig. 19. --- Black Spherule with Metallic Nucleus (60:1). This spherule, covered with a coating of black shining magnetite, represents the most frequent shape. The depression here shown is often found at the surface of these spherules. From 2375 fathoms, South Pacific.]()

[Fig. 20. --- Black Spherule with Metallic Nucleus (60:1). The black external coating of magnetic oxide has been broken away to show the metallic centre, represented by the clear part at the centre. From 3150 fathoms, Atlantic.]()

We are next shown that these metallic chondroi occur with stony chondroi, so that if the interpretation of a cosmic origin for the magnetic spherules with a metallic centre be not considered established in a manner absolutely beyond question, it almost becomes so when we take into account their association with the silicate spherules, never found in rocks of a terrestrial origin. These are thus described ---

Among the fragments attracted by the magnet in deep-sea deposits, we distinguish granules slightly larger than the spherules with the shining black coating above described. These are yellowish-brown, with a bronze-like lustre, and under the microscope it is noticed that the surface, instead of being quite smooth, is grooved by thin lamellæ. In size they never exceed a millimetre --- generally they are about 0.5 millimetre in diameter; they are never perfect spheres, as in the case of the black spherules with a metallic centre; and sometimes a depression more or less marked is to be observed in the periphery. When examined by the microscope, we observe that the lamellæ which compose them are applied the one against the other, and have a radial eccentric disposition. It is the leafy radial structure (_radialblättrig_), like that of the _chondres_ of bronzite, which predominates in our preparations. We have observed much less rarely the serial structure of the _chondres_ with olivine, and indeed there is some doubt about the indications of this last type of structure. Fig. 21 shows the characters and texture of one of these spherules magnified twenty-five diameters.

It is worthy of remark that, associated with these chondroi in the red muds at the greatest depths in the ocean, are found manganese nodules in enormous numbers. If a section be made of one of these, a number of concentric layers will be observed arranged around a central nucleus --- the same as in a urinary calculus. When the peroxide of manganese is removed by strong hydrochloric acid, there remains a clayey skeleton which still more strongly resembles a urinary calculus, according to Mr. Murray.

This skeleton contains crystals of olivine, quartz, augite, magnetite, or any other materials which were contained in the clay from which the nodule was taken. In the process of its deposition around a nucleus, the peroxide of manganese has enclosed and incorporated in the nodule the clay and crystals and other materials in which the nucleus was embedded. The clayey skeletons thus vary with the clay or ooze in which they were formed. Those from a fine clay usually adhere well together; those from a globigerina ooze have an areolar appearance; while those from a clay with many fine sandy particles usually fall to pieces. Mr. Murray attributes the origin of these nodules entirely to the decomposition of volcanic rocks ---

Wherever we have pumice containing much magnetite, olivine, augite, or hornblende, and these apparently undergoing decomposition and alteration, or where we have evidence of great showers of volcanic ash, there we find the manganese in greatest abundance. This correspondence between the distribution of the manganese and volcanic _débris_ appears to me very significant of the origin of the former. I regard the manganese, as we find it, as one of the secondary products arising from the decomposition of volcanic minerals.

Manganese is as frequent as iron in lavas, being usually associated with it, though in very much smaller amount. In magnetite and in some varieties of augite and hornblende the protoxide of iron is at times partially replaced by that of manganese.

In the manganese of these minerals and in the carbonic acid and oxygen of ocean waters we have the requisite conditions for the decomposition of the minerals, the solution of the manganese, and its subsequent deposition as a peroxide.

An analysis of one of these nodules by Professor Rénard (_Challenger Report, Narrative_, vol. 1., Part 2., p. 1048) gives the following:---

Water (H2O)|9.51  
Silica (SiO2)|19.34  
Lime (CaO)|3.19  
Alumina (Al2O3)|6.36  
Ferric oxide (Fe2O3)|26.70  
Magnesia (MgO)|1.79  
Oxide of manganese (MnO)|26.46  
Oxide of nickel (NiO)|1.82  
Oxygen|6.31  |101.48 

The specimen examined was from Station 276, 2350 fathoms, South Pacific.

I have observed the spectra of some of the nodules, which were kindly placed at my disposal by Mr. Murray.

In the oxy-coal-gas flame, lines of sodium, thallium, lithium, potassium, manganese, and iron are seen. The brightness and persistence of the thallium line at 535 is very remarkable, and is especially interesting, since the line has been recorded in the spectrum of the aurora and of some meteorites. The red line of lithium, which is seen in the spectra of many meteorites, is also bright in the spectrum of the nodules. The manganese fluting at 558, the one coincident with the chief line of the aurora, is also seen in the spectrum of the nodules, but it is not nearly so bright as the thallium line. The iron lines are very faint. As might be expected, from the association with sea-water, the lines of sodium and potassium are very bright. A photograph of the flame spectrum shows lines of manganese, and some of the strongest violet lines of iron.

When some fragments of the nodules are placed along an end-on vacuum-tube and the spark passed, flutings of carbon and lines of hydrogen appear, almost exactly as they do when meteorites are subjected to the same treatment. When the tube is made red-hot, the thallium line becomes very bright, and also the yellow and green lines of sodium.

It will be seen that the spectra of the nodules are somewhat different from those of meteorites, chiefly in the relative intensities of the lines, but the difference can probably be explained by considering the effect of sea-water. I have the authority of my friend Professor Thorpe for stating that thallium and manganese would be the most likely of the meteoritic constituents to form insoluble compounds, and hence these are what we should expect to find in deep-sea accumulations of meteoritic dust. The spectroscopic observations therefore seem to show that it is not improbable that the manganese nodules owe their origin, in some part at least, to such dust.

The question arises, therefore, whether the origin of these deep-sea concretionary deposits of iron and manganese, which are unrepresented in any deep-sea geological deposit, may not be in part, even if in small part, meteoritic, and represent, like the chondroi, another form of fallen dust.

At the suggestion of Professor Rénard I separated some of the iron spherules from the nodules by dissolving in dilute hydrochloric acid, and passing a magnet through the insoluble residue. In the oxy-coal-gas flame, the spectrum of the spherules consisted of lines of iron, sodium, and potassium, and the flutings of manganese, but there was absolutely no trace of thallium. An examination of the residue after the separation of the iron particles, however, gave indications of thallium as strongly as the nodules themselves. On evaporating the solution to dryness and observing the spectrum, no thallium was visible.

If we are justified in regarding the partly meteoritic origin of the nodules as established, the excess of thallium shows that each nodule represents a very considerable quantity of meteoritic dust, since there is only a comparatively small proportion of thallium in meteorites. This further suggests that an enormous quantity of dust passes through our atmosphere, especially as that which falls on the sea only represents a portion of the total amount.

# Part 4. Meteorites in the Solar System.

## Section 1. --- Meteor Swarms give rise to the Appearances round the Sun.

### Chapter 11. Meteorites and Bodies which, like the Earth, travel round the Sun.

We have seen that the phenomena which accompany meteorites entering our air, whether they are soon burnt up and give rise only to the appearance of a shooting or falling star, or whether they are bulky enough to withstand the melting process till they reach the earth's surface, are similar. We are now in a position to discuss all these phenomena on the assumption that they have a common origin.

It is not so many years ago since planetary space was supposed to be untenanted by anything more tangible than that mysterious fluid called ether. This notion is exactly represented by the French equivalent for that space, _le vide planétaire_. Hence, not to mention imagined supernatural causes --- such as that, for instance, embodied in the tradition that Saint Lawrence, on the anniversary of his martyrdom (10th August), shed burning tears --- the cause of the phenomenon was ascribed to atmospheric perturbations, exhalations of sulphur, _ignes fatui_, and so forth. An account of the August shower of 1857, even, published in the _Bulletin de l'Académie Royale de Belgique_, is accompanied by a minute record of rain, temperature, atmospheric electricity, _etc._

Leaving out of consideration the opinions of the ancients, among whom Anaxagoras and Seneca may be especially mentioned, as being in favour of a cosmical origin, it may be pointed out that Kepler* regarded meteorites and shooting-stars as akin, and derived both from the ethereal regions.

*) _Opera_, ed. Fritsch, vol. 6. p. 157.

Halley* was the next to express an opinion that shooting-stars were of cosmical origin, but to Chladni belongs the credit of having broached the theory which modern observations have so abundantly justified. This theory was that space was full of the matter which, attracted by the earth, entered its atmosphere, accompanied by luminous effects only, in some cases, and by actual falls of the matter, in others.* The general acceptance of this view was retarded by Laplace and others, who saw a more probable origin for the phenomena by supposing meteorites to be masses shot out of lunar volcanoes. The first step in the demonstration of the former theory, which is now universally accepted, was made when Chladni, in 1794, showed that no known terrestrial agency was capable of producing masses like the meteorites which had been seen to fall. At his and Lichtenbergh's suggestion, Brandes and Benzenberg* in 1798 proved that, whatever they appear to do, shooting-stars never shoot upwards, but always downwards towards the earth. At the same time he showed the similarity of phenomena presented by fire-balls, shooting-stars, and the fall of meteorites. He subsequently returned to and strengthened this view.*

Should it be asked how such masses originated, or by what means they were brought into such an insulated position, this question would be the same as if it were asked how the planets originated. Whatever hypothesis we may form, we must either admit that the planets, if we except the many revolutions which they may have undergone, either on or near their surface, have always been since their first formation, and ever will be, the same; or that Nature, acting on created matter, possesses the power to produce worlds and whole systems, to destroy them, and from their materials to form new ones. For the latter opinion there are, indeed, more grounds than the former, as alternations of destruction and creation are exhibited by all organised and unorganised bodies on our earth; which gives us reason to suspect that Nature, to which greatness and smallness, considered in general, are merely relative terms, can produce more effects of the same kind on a larger scale.

But many variations have been observed on distant bodies, which, in some measure, render the last opinion probable; for example, the appearing and total disappearing of certain stars, when they do not depend upon periodical changes. If we now admit that planetary bodies have started into existence, we cannot suppose that such an event can have otherwise taken place, than by conjecturing that either particles of matter, which were before dispersed throughout infinite space, in a more soft and chaotic condition, have united together in large masses, by the power of attraction; or that new planetary bodies have been formed from the fragments of much larger ones that have been broken to pieces, either perhaps by some external shock, or by an internal explosion. Let whichever of these hypotheses be the truest, it is not improbable, or at least contrary to nature, if we suppose that a large quantity of such material particles, either on account of their too great distance, or because prevented by a stronger movement in another direction, may not have united themselves to the larger accumulating mass of a new world; but have remained insulated, and, impelled by some shock, have continued their course through infinite space, until they approach so near to some planet as to be within the sphere of its attraction, and then by falling down to occasion the phenomena before mentioned.

It is worthy of remark that iron is the principal component part of all the masses of this kind hitherto discovered; that it is found almost everywhere on the surface of the earth as a component part of many substances in the vegetable and animal kingdom; and that the effects of magnetism give us reason to conclude that there is a large provision of it in the interior parts of the earth. We may therefore conjecture that iron in general is the principal matter employed in the formation of new planetary bodies; and it is still further probable by the circumstance that it is exclusively connected with the magnetic power, and also, on account of their polarity, may be necessary to these bodies. It is also probable, if the above theory be just, that other substances contained in such fallen masses, such as sulphur, siliceous earth, manganese, _etc._, may be peculiar, not to our globe alone, but may belong to the common materials employed in the formation of all planetary worlds.

This paper of Chladni's, it will be seen, dates from just before the beginning of the present century.

The subject was invested with a new interest in 1799, when the great Humboldt, who was then travelling in South America, saw an enormous number of shooting-stars covering the sky. In his long account of the shower in his _Personal Narrative_ he states that, from the beginning of the phenomenon, there was not a space in the firmament equal in extent to three diameters of the moon that was not filled at every instant with bolides and falling stars; while he was locally informed that during a previous display in 1766 the inhabitants of Cumana had beheld the neighbouring volcano, Cayamba, veiled for an hour by a similar exhibition.

In the next display, observed in the year 1833, 240,000 meteors were computed by Arago to have been visible above the horizon of Boston on the morning of 13th November; while Mr. Baxendell, who observed the shower from the west coast of Mexico, states that "the number of meteors seen at once often equalled the apparent number of the fixed stars seen at a glance."

Olmsted, when he had witnessed the shower of 1833 (a shower heralded and followed by less brilliant displays in 1831-1832 and 1834-1836), and when, moreover, he had compared the phenomena with those recorded by Humboldt and Bonpland in 1799, announced the view which has since been so brilliantly confirmed, that the appearances are due to the passage of the earth through a _storm_, so to speak, of planetary bodies.

This was the first blow given to _le vide planétaire_. Space, instead of being empty, was full of bodies, some of them being congregated into rings, each body composing the ring revolving like a planet round the sun. In fact, these rings may be compared to _tangible orbits_; indeed, they almost realise the schoolboy's idea of an orbit, as a considerable part of the path is occupied by a string of little planets, while in the case of our earth's orbit, for instance, each point of the path is occupied in succession only.

Still Olmsted did not accept the view that the falling stars were of the same nature as meteorites. His penetration, however, enabled him to note the fact that --- however numerous the falling stars might be; in whatever direction they appeared; or whatever the apparent lengths of their paths; --- the lines of direction of these paths, retraced along the sky, nearly all found a common focus of emanation or visual centre of projection among the fixed stars. This has since been called the radiant point.

The most salient fact, noticed during the subsequent display in 1866, even by those who did not recognise its significance, was that all the meteors seemed to come from the same region of the sky. Among all those seen by myself from 11 P. M. on Tuesday, 13th November, till 2 A. M. on Wednesday, 14th November, two only were exceptions to the general direction. In fact, there was a region in which the meteors appeared trainless, and shone out for a moment like so many stars, because they were directly approaching us. Near this spot they were so numerous, and all so foreshortened, and for the most part faint, that the sky at times put on almost a phosphorescent appearance. As the eye travelled from this region the flights became longer, those, as a rule, being longest which first made their appearance overhead, or which trended westward. Now, if the paths of all had been projected backwards, they would have intersected in one region, and that region the one in which the most foreshortened ones were seen. So decidedly did this fact come out that there were moments in which the meteors belted the sky like the meridians on a terrestrial globe, the pole of the globe being represented by a point in the constellation Leo. In fact, they all seemed to _radiate_ from that point, and _radiant point_, as we have seen, is precisely the name given to it by astronomers. _Vanishing point_, if the bull were permissible, is a term which would represent the fact rather than the appearance, which is an effect of perspective; and hence we gather that the paths of the meteors are parallel, or nearly so, and that they diverge therefore from a definite place in the sky. The point from which they proceed in the case of the swarm we are now considering lies in the sickle of Leo, situated in longitude 142° and latitude 8° 30′ N., according to Professor Newton. These meteors are called Leonids.

[Fig. 22. --- The Radiant Point of the November Meteors.]()

[Fig. 23. --- Radiant Point of Long Duration (October-November), Denning.]()

Meteor showers are generally of short duration, but Mr. Denning has shown that there are cases in which falling stars emanate from the same part of the sky for long periods of time.

He finds that during several months certain apparent radiant points maintain a stationary position amongst the stars. From July to September there appears to be a continuous display from the point in R. A. 6°, Dec. +11°, and, during the last six months of the year, shooting-stars almost incessantly fall from centres at 47° +44°, 73° +41°, 77° +33°, _etc._ Throughout the autumn and winter months there occurs an intermittent display from 154° +41°. These are merely instanced as examples of a numerous class. The agreement in the positions of the several showers, as determined at different periods, is so close that it is extremely difficult to believe they can result simply from the accidental grouping together of distinct meteor systems. On the other hand, it seems impossible to explain satisfactorily these durable radiant points, and it is evident that this special part of the subject requires further close investigation.

One of these long-duration radiants between Auriga and Taurus is shown in the accompanying illustration (Fig. 24).

The August meteors (Perseids) also show a long duration, the entire interval over which the display is spread being from 8th July to 22d August. But the radiant is not stationary;* it becomes displaced from night to night, and its apparent motion is to the east. This feature is a well attested fact of observation. The positions of the radiant on different nights are as follow ---

*) Denning first announced this fact in _Nature_, vol. 16. p. 362.

[TABLE]

The April meteors (Lyrids) give similar indications that their radiant point is in rapid motion eastward amongst the stars.*

*) _Nature_, vol. 32. p. 5.

The next point, first brought to light by Olmsted, was that during a display the radiant point moves diurnally with the stars across the heavens.  This is another strong argument in favour of the cosmical theory.

Meteors which appear singly and occasionally are called sporadic meteors, but in addition to these, which we may reckon to see every night, there are at certain times of the year very well-known and rich falls; so well known that we can say at once that on the 28th of July, 10th of August, and 10th of December more falling-stars will be seen than are ordinarily visible. These are termed systematic or periodic meteors, and those to which we have just referred as appearing in November are of this class.

From 1833-1863 evidence was rapidly accumulated indicating that a very large proportion of the shooting-stars observed were not sporadic, but really systematic --- that is to say, that at certain periods of the year meteors might be expected to diverge from radiant points in those particular parts of the sky, and in greater numbers from those parts than from elsewhere.

[Fig. 24. --- Position of the Long-Duration Radiant among the Stars.]()

During these years a considerable number of radiant points had been made out, and therefore the existence of a considerable number of streams or swarms had been suggested if not established. In 1863 Professor H. A. Newton used these facts to strengthen the cosmical hypothesis.

The observations of Humboldt --- modern observations, so to speak --- were repeated, as we have seen, in 1833, on the same day (or one day later) of the same month in which Humboldt had made his observation in 1799, and again one day later in 1866 there was a recurrence of the same thing. Now these dates are separated by an equal interval of thirty-three years. The idea of periodicity was therefore suggested both for this and other displays, and this gave rise to so great an interest in the question that an investigation was made whether falls had been recorded at previous intervals of thirty-three years, or whether it was a new event first seen by Humboldt in 1799, or possibly by the Cumanese in 1766.

Professor Newton took up the inquiry, and was soon able to show that the various chronicles of star-showers from the very earliest times, when properly discussed, indicated that the principal streams suggested by the observations since 1833 had really, at variously recurrent intervals since the beginning of astronomical observation, given indications of their existence.* He especially indicated such cases of constant recurrences of showers in April, August, November, and December.

*) _Silliman's Journal_, vol. 36. p. 146, 1863.

The discussion of the dates of these showers in the early records showed a constant slow change of date in one direction or the other. This obviously demonstrated that the showers were independent of the tropical year --- that is to say, of the earth's motion round the sun; and it is difficult to understand how a more definite proof of their cosmical origin could be afforded.

We may conveniently confine our remarks on this point to the inquiries relating to the "Leonid" swarm of meteorites which gives rise to the November display.

Newton and others found that we possess records, dating from 902 A. D., proving that about every thirty-three years since that time the heavens have been hung with gold. The Arab historian, Abu-l'Abbas ad-Dimashkî, chronicled the star-shower of 19th October in the year 1202 of our era in the following words, the while Chinese astronomers carefully watched the constellations in which the meteors appeared and vanished from the sight:---

In the year 599, on the last day of Muharram, stars shot hither and thither, and flew one against another like a swarm of locusts; this phenomenon lasted until daybreak; people were thrown into consternation, and made importunate supplications to God the most High; there was never the like seen except on the coming out of the messenger of God --- on whom be benediction and peace.

This table for the November display, from Professor Newton, shows what the result of searching the old records was ---

[TABLE]

*) H. A. Newton, _Bul. Ac. R. Belg._, 17. No. 6.

*) In many countries the change from old to new style was made in this interval, commencing from 1582 in Spain, Portugal, and Italy.

These ancient records enabled Professor Newton to place the planetary nature of the November ring beyond all doubt.

It is evident that if this ring crosses our orbit in a certain definite point in space, the earth will always traverse it when occupying the same definite point of its orbit with regard to the stars, provided the ring does not change its place. But our ordinary year, called the tropical year, is affected by the precession of the equinoxes, as it is measured from equinox to equinox, so that we do not measure it by the stars, but by an empirical point called the first point of the sign Aries, which is actually at the present moment in the constellation Pisces. If we refer the recorded star-showers to the sidereal year, or a fixed equinox, we should find an almost absolute identity in the dates of their appearance if there were no perturbation, but we shall see subsequently that there is perturbation, and this is a final demonstration of cosmical origin.

If there is a swarm of meteorites falling in any particular direction towards the plane of the ecliptic, these meteorites will take little account of the precession of the equinoxes or the tropical year; the earth must take the meteorites as she finds them. The one great leap in the table was due to the alteration of the calendar, as there was a difference of twelve days between the old and new reckoning. Professor Newton, Professor Adams, and others have given a complete demonstration that from the year 902 a swarm of meteorites has been encountered by the earth every thirty-three years or thereabouts, and nearly in the same part of her orbit round the sun.

By a study of the position and _lie_ of the earth in her orbit we can see from what part of space these meteors, these more numerous swarms, come. Suppose, for instance, that at one part of the earth's orbit there is a stream of meteorites plunging down nearly vertically towards the ecliptic; the earth in passing through them would receive the greatest number of blows on its exterior atmosphere on the hemisphere above the plane of the ecliptic at the time, while the other hemisphere would be entirely sheltered, so that the direction of the fall would be capable of demonstration by a consideration of the earth's direction and the relation of its surface to the plane of the ecliptic at the time.

The observations indicate that these bodies are moving towards the plane of the ecliptic, from its northern side, into that part of it through which the earth passes in her annual journey in November; they are, in fact, moving round the sun in an orbit inclined at a not very large angle (17°) to the plane of the earth's orbit.

Similarly, we might observe the August ring rising from one of its nodes, situated in the point of the earth's orbit occupied by our planet on 10th August, not at a slight angle like the November ring, but at an angle of 79° or 80°.

It is important to make this point quite clear.

Let us conceive the sun and earth to be half immersed in an infinite ocean which will represent to us the plane of the ecliptic, and let us further for greater simplicity assume that the earth's motion round the sun (in a direction contrary to the hands of a watch) is performed in a circular path with the sun at the centre; let us, moreover, suppose the earth's path, or orbit, to be marked by buoys, remembering that astronomers define the position of a heavenly body in the plane by stating its _longitude_ --- that is, its angular distance, reckoning from right to left, from a particular startpoint, as seen from the sun; and its _latitude_ --- that is, its angular height above the plane as seen from the same body.

Now, if it were possible to buoy various points of the earth's orbit in the plane of the ecliptic in the convenient manner before suggested, we should see the meteor-ring of "Leonids" meeting the waves of our hypothetical ocean, at a slight angle (17°), at the point of the earth's orbit occupied by our planet on 14th November, the point where they pierce them being called the _node_. Where the other node lies, where the meteorites cross the plane again, we do not exactly know; we only know that they do not cross our orbit; if they did, another star-shower would occur in May.

Let us inquire into this point a little more closely. Let us, in imagination, connect the earth and sun by a straight line; at any moment the direction of the earth's motion will be at right angles to that line (or a tangent to its orbit); therefore, as longitudes are reckoned, as we have seen, from right to left, the motion will be directed to a point 90° of longitude behind the sun. The sun's longitude at noon on 14th November was 232°, within a few minutes; 90° from this gives us 142°, which, as we have seen, is precisely the longitude of the radiant point. This, then, is proof positive enough that, in longitude at least, the meteoritic hail was fairly directed against, and as fairly met by, the earth.

But it will be asked, If the radiant point is situated in latitude 8° 30′, how comes it that the inclination of the ring is stated to be 17°? should it not rather be 8° 30′? To this question we may reply by another: How comes it that, when we are hurrying through a shower, we always incline an umbrella at a less angle with the ground than that formed by the falling rain? The answer is the same in both cases. In the case of the meteorites, if our motion in one direction differs little from theirs, they appear to us to fall at an angle which is also almost precisely half of their real one.

Similar ancient records relating to star-showers seen in March and April, and July and August, showed that the earth's longitude was always the same when they were observed, if it was referred to a _fixed equinox_. The constant longitude for the star-showers anciently recorded to have taken place in March-April corresponds to April 20.1d., 1850, and for a like number seen in July-August, August 9.0d., 1850. The longitude for the showers recorded in October-November advances along the ecliptic from a fixed equinox with a uniform motion of 52′′ per annum. Such a motion as this must be due to planetary perturbation, and hence we are in presence of cosmical phenomena.

The form and dimensions of the orbit of the August meteors, which is very steeply inclined to the ecliptic, were calculated by the German astronomer, Erman, from the many combined observations and determinations of heights of those meteors made at German Observatories in the years following the great November showers of 1832-1833. _But an exact value of their velocity was still wanting_; and from an approximate measure of the velocity of the "Perseids," obtained from observations of a fine meteor of the shower in America on 10th August 1861, Professor H. A. Newton found elements of the ring, concluding it to be not far from circular in form, and nearly perpendicular in its plane to the ecliptic.

It is to the American astronomer, Professor Newton, that we owe the earliest investigation into the constitution of the November ring. He first considered the question whether the ring is of uniform density, and whether it lies merely near our orbit; the variation in the brilliancy of the showers being caused by the action of the planets and moon on the earth and ring --- the greatest perturbation of the earth being 9000 miles each way --- sometimes throwing us into the ring, sometimes causing us to pass it without encountering it. He has shown, however, that the ring cannot be of uniform density throughout, but that, on the other hand, in one part of it there is a clustering together of the little bodies of which it is composed --- a few stragglers being scattered along the rest of its circuit.

From other considerations he showed that the meteors revolve round the sun in a direction opposed to the earth's motion, the most probable time of revolution being, according to his first view, 354.621 days, our own being accomplished in 365.256 days. This is the same as saying that the annual motion of the group is 1 + 1/33.25 revolutions. Consequently, the centre of the group is brought, on this view, into contact with the earth once in every 133 years, but the earth passes very near the centre four times in this interval.

On this view the orbit of the swarm would be nearly circular.

With regard to the rings generally, Professor Newton made out in 1865 1. that all the sporadic shooting-stars cannot belong to a narrow ring which has a diameter approaching in size that of the earth; and 2. that a large portion of the meteorites, when they meet the earth, are travelling faster than it is, or else that the sporadic meteors form a series of radiants at some distance from the ecliptic, and hence come from a series of rings considerably inclined to the plane of the ecliptic.

Further, he pointed out that the distribution of the orbits of the meteorites must be one or other of the following:---

1\. They may form rings passing near the earth's orbit at many points along its circuit (sporadic meteors may be outliers of such a ring).

2\. They may form a disk in the plane of the ecliptic.

3\. They may be distributed at random like the orbits of comets.

### Chapter 12. Demonstration of the Cosmical Hypothesis.

We shall see next that another line of thought and inquiry was required to completely establish the cosmical hypothesis by giving us data as to the _velocities_ of the meteorites.

This was that the sporadic meteors --- those which made their appearance by chance, so to speak --- were always more numerous in the morning than in the evening hours, and further, that the number seen in the northern hemisphere in one half year was greater than that seen in the other. These facts, although at first they seemed to connect these phenomena with our terrestrial hours, and therefore were at first considered to militate against the cosmical hypothesis, were subsequently shown, by Bompas, A. S. Herschel, H. A. Newton, and Schiaparelli, to be a distinct proof that the bodies were moving in space with a velocity not incomparable with, but at the same time somewhat greater than, that of the earth itself; that therefore they were moving with planetary velocities, and therefore were truly members of the solar system.

The work of M. Coulvier-Gravier* was the first to indicate the rise and fall of the horary numbers between sunset and sunrise. It was the dependence of these phenomena upon certain terrestrial hours which made that eminent observer decline to consider their origin as in any way cosmical.

*) _Recherches sur les Météores_, p. 219 (Paris, 1859).

Mr. Bompas,* commenting on the numbers obtained by Coulvier-Gravier, wrote ---

*) _Monthly Notices_, vol. 17. p. 148.

The part of the heavens towards which the earth is moving at any time is always six hours from the sun. At 6 A. M. the observer's meridian is in the direction of the earth's motion; and at 6 P. M. in the opposite.

Thus the greatest number of meteors are encountered when the observer's meridian is in the direction of the earth's motion, and the number diminishes from thence to 6 P.M., when he looks the opposite way.

M. Coulvier-Gravier's numbers were as follows ---

[TABLE]

Fig. 25 will make Mr. Bompas's idea clear. The front half of the earth ploughing its way through space is unshaded; an observer is being carried along the line of the earth's motion at sunrise, the earth is behind him, so to speak, and the point towards which the earth is travelling lies 90° in longitude behind the sun.

Combining these facts, Bompas explained the results on the principle that if the meteors be distributed equally in space they would converge to the earth, if at rest, equally on all sides. But if the earth be in motion, and with a velocity one-half the average velocity of the meteors, they would converge to it more on the side towards which it is moving than on the other; and in the proportion of nearly two-thirds of the number, would have an apparent motion more or less opposed to that of the earth, and would apparently diverge from the point towards which the earth is moving, with a gradual increase in number from 6 P. M. to 6 A. M.

Before we proceed to show the bearing of this matter, a word must be said with regard to the actual conditions under which these bodies reach us from space, and how their fall upon the earth and their appearance in the heavens, even in the case of no fall, have been investigated.

[Fig. 25. --- Diagram showing why more Falling Stars are seen after Midnight.]()

To approach the proof of the cosmical hypothesis afforded by these observations, we may begin by supposing the earth at rest. If the movements of the cosmical particles are in all directions, they will fall equally on all parts of the earth, and even the earth's rotation will make no difference. But if we assume the earth's movement in its orbit to be much more rapid than the movements of the meteorites, it is clear that its forward half will receive blows while the hinder half cannot.

Suppose that all the regions of space swept through by the earth in its orbit round the sun were occupied here and there by meteorites moving like the earth in orbits round the sun, and let us assume for the moment that they are pretty nearly equally distributed and are moving in all directions.

Under these circumstances the earth in movement in its orbit, at the rate of about 1000 miles a minute, would be sweeping through them all the year round, and we should get the appearance of a shooting-star or the fall of a meteorite every day in the year. Careful observations in climates most convenient for these researches, where the sky is freest from cloud and is purest, show, as we have seen, that there is not only no night but no hour without a falling star. We are therefore justified in considering that practically the part of the solar system which is swept through by the earth is not a vacuum, not empty space, but space occupied by meteorites here and there.

If these meteoritic bodies are equally distributed and are going in the same direction as the earth, but moving more quickly, they would follow and catch the earth; if they were travelling in the same direction as the earth, but more slowly, we should overtake them, and the two sides of the earth separated by a plane at right angles to the tangent to the part of the orbit along which it is moving at the time (see Fig. 25) would experience a different condition. One side would be bombarded by the greater number of meteorites in the former case, while in the latter the forward half only would be affected. The assumption, however, is that they are travelling in all directions; hence the numbers which fall on the front hemisphere compared with those that fall on the opposite one --- in other words, the numbers seen at sunrise as compared with those seen at sunset --- must depend wholly on the velocity of the earth as compared with the mean velocity of the meteorites.

The point of space towards which the earth is travelling at any moment, shown in Fig. 25, has been called "the apex of the earth's way"•; the point of space it is leaving the "anti-apex."*

*) These terms were suggested by Professor Pritchard. In 1866 Schiaparelli suggested _point de mire_. Quite recently, Professor Newton, of Yale, has suggested "goal" and "quit."

The apex of the earth's way is always 90° of longitude behind the sun.

Having, then, this general view of the movement of the earth in her orbit, we are in a position to discuss Mr. Bompas's argument, and we cannot do better than use the explanation given by Professor Pritchard to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1864,* which really possesses an historical interest.

*) _Monthly Notices_, 1864, vol. 24. p. 138.

Our object is to show that this hypothetical uniformity of distribution, combined with the direction and amount of the earth's motion, will have a very sensible effect on the number of meteors actually visible at a given place, at a given hour of the night, as explained (in a somewhat different way) by Mr. Bompas [and at a given season of the year, as extended by Mr. Herschel].

[Fig. 26. --- Professor Pritchard's Umbrella Diagram.]()

For the purpose of illustration, suppose H O R (Fig. 26) to represent a flat umbrella, of which N O is the stick; suppose, also, rain to fall upon it equally, and in all directions: then, if the umbrella be at rest, as much rain will fall upon its front, looking from Z, as on its back, from N.

But now suppose the umbrella itself lias a motion from O to E in a given time, and, for the simplicity of first conception, let O E represent also the uniform velocity of the rain: very much more rain will now fall on the front of H O R, and much less on the back of H O R, than before. In fact, if O _m_ be taken = O E, and the angle _m_ O R be made = R O E, and the parallelogram _m_ E be completed, then a raindrop, of which _m_'s real path is M E, would, by the motion of H O R, just graze along the front surface of H O R in the direction M R O, when it arrives at E. Moreover, all the rain which at the beginning of the motion was moving within the angle _m_ O R, which would have fallen on the back of H O R at rest, will now fall on the front of H O R, if in motion.

The application of this hypothetical case to that of meteors is obvious. H O R now represents the horizon, Z the zenith of an observer, and O E the direction and magnitude of the earth's orbital motion. The earth's diurnal motion of rotation is comparatively too small to be taken into account for our present purposes. So long, then, as O E, the direction of the earth's orbital motion, is in front of the horizon of an observer, there will thereby occur to him an additional flow (and partial combustion) of meteors against the earth's atmosphere above him; and this increased flow will become the greater as the angle R O E becomes greater. If O E be below H O R, then the number of visible meteors will thereby be diminished.

Now, if we refer to Fig. 25 we shall see that the observer does not reach the forward part of the earth (with reference to the apex of the earth's way) till midnight, and that the apex rises gradually till it is on his meridian at sunrise.

Here, then, is the reason why the number increases from sunset to early morning, based upon the theory of their cosmical origin, and really explainable in no other way.

Now for the yearly conditions as revealed by observation.

The monthly number of meteors revealed by a large mass of observations in England and abroad has been summarised as follows* ---

*) Denning, _Monthly Notices_, vol. 47. p. 37.

[TABLE]

The relatively excessive numbers in April and August are due in a great measure to the occurrence of the rich displays of 20th April (Lyrids) and 10th August (Perseids), which have induced a large number of observations at these special epochs.

Professor A. Herschel was the first to point out that this yearly difference, as well as the daily difference in the hourly numbers, arrived at by Coulvier-Gravier, demonstrated the cosmical origin. In 1864 he wrote as follows, assuming that the meteorites travelled faster than the earth* ---

*) _Monthly Notices_, vol. 24.

A season of frequency of aërolites, shooting-stars, and bolides must be expected to succeed, in all latitudes, three months later than the summer season of the sun; but, on the other hand, a dearth of meteors, in the spring, one quarter of a year later than mid-winter. In general, and in all latitudes, the meteoric seasons, or seasons of meteoric frequency, must strictly follow the tropical seasons, and three months later in the year. Thus, in the earth's northern hemisphere, the Northern Pole remains directed to the sun from the equinox of March until that of September, and to the course of meteors from the solstice of June to the solstice of December. The greatest frequency of the meteorites will fall about the equinox of autumn, in September and October. This most nearly agrees with the European observations. The meteoric season of Arago may, therefore, be drawn as a consequence from his planetary hypothesis, if it be permitted to change the limits which he assigns to it by a small quantity --- namely, from the Earth's apsides to its solstices in its orbit.

The same fact, which appears strongly marked with regard to shooting-stars in the eight years' summary of Dr. Schmidt, is found repeated in a striking manner in the existing _Northern Catalogues of Star-showers, Fire-balls, and Aëroliths_. The following references may be taken as examples: ---

[TABLE]

It was next pointed out, by Newton* and Schiaparelli,* that, provided the actual facts of the daily and yearly variation were sufficiently assured, the true velocities of these bodies in space could not be just simply similar to the earth's velocity, nor their paths in space planetary orbits like that of the earth, and of about the same dimensions; but that, as their motion was much faster, their orbits would be variously distributed parabolas, and they would consequently be more akin to comets.

*) _Les Mondes_, vol. 13.

That the movement was really much faster was argued in 1865, from the duration of the flight of shooting-stars, by Professor Newton.* Wartmann's observations of the duration of the flights of 368 shooting-stars at Geneva during one night by six observers, gave a mean of 0.49s. for each flight. The mean of 499 estimates made in August and November 1864 is 0.418s. The mean duration of the 867 flights is 0.45s.

*) _Silliman's Journal_, vol. 39. p. 203.

Professor Newton remarks ---

A mean duration of half a second, and a mean length of path between 39 and 65 kilometres, imply a mean velocity between 78 and 130 kilometres per second. The smallest of these (more than 48 miles) is twice and a half the velocity of the earth in its orbit about the sun. This cannot consist with the supposition that most of the meteoroids move in closed orbits about the sun.

Both the briefness, however, of this assumed duration, and even the least limit, accordingly, of the velocity so found, were presumed by Professor Newton to be probably overrated.

The final step in this demonstration was taken by Schiaparelli, but, before this, Newton had distinctly shown that most of the meteors visible were not single in their movements round the sun, but that they belonged to systematic streams, and that these streams were not rings.

With special reference to the November ring, Professor Schiaparelli* came to the conclusion that the orbit, instead of being nearly circular, as Newton had at first supposed, was very elongated, like those of comets; and Professor Adams* demonstrated shortly afterwards that, among several possible periods of the stream which Professor Newton had already indicated, the true period was 33.25 years, the demonstration depending upon the increase of the longitude of the node by the action of the planets Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, the calculated increase amounting to 28′, while the actual increase was 29′, and he gave the following elements of the orbit of the swarm:---

*) _Bulletino Meteorologico dell' Osservatorio del Collegio Romano_, vol. 5., 1866.

*) _Monthly Notices_, vol. 26. p. 247, April 1867.

[TABLE]

Aided by considerations depending upon observations of the conditions under which the meteors were seen --- from a particular part of the sky; in a particular part of the earth's orbit; at a particular time; and from a particular point of the earth's surface, --- we can understand at once that it was as practicable to determine the orbit of the swarm as it is to determine the orbit of a planet or of a comet.

_Distribution of Meteorites in the Solar System._

The _vide planétaire_ is now ultimately abolished, and we find the solar system to be a meteoritic _plenum_ in which sporadic meteorites and swarms of greater or less density are moving in orbits more or less elongated round the sun.

The demonstration that meteorites are extra-terrestrial bodies has been followed by researches which, as they have become more complete and searching, have gradually driven men of science to increase their estimates, till at last the numbers acknowledged to exist in what was formerly supposed to be empty space have become enormous.

Observations of sporadic falling stars have been used to determine the average number of meteorites which attempt to pierce the earth's atmosphere during each twenty-four hours. Dr. Schmidt, of Athens, from observations made during seventeen years, found that the mean hourly number of luminous meteors visible on a clear moonless night by one observer was fourteen, taking the time of observation from midnight to 1 A. M.

It has been further experimentally shown that a large group of observers who might include the whole horizon in their observations would see about six times as many as are visible to one eye. Professor H. A. Newton and others have calculated that, making all proper corrections, the number which might be visible over the whole earth would be a little greater than 10,000 times as many as could be seen at one place. From this we gather that not less than 20,000,000 luminous meteors fall upon our planet daily, each of which in a dark clear night would present us with the well-known phenomenon of a shooting-star.

This number, however, by no means represents all the sporadic meteorites that enter our atmosphere, because many entirely invisible to the naked eye are often seen in telescopes. It has been suggested that the number of meteorites if these were included would be increased at least twentyfold; this would give us 400,000,000 meteorites penetrating the earth's atmosphere daily.

If we consider only those meteorites visible to the _naked eye_ as sporadic meteors or falling stars, and if we further assume that their absolute velocity in space is equal to that of comets moving in parabolic orbits, Professor H. A. Newton has shown that the average number of meteorites in the space that the earth traverses is in each volume equal to the earth about 30,000. This gives us as a result in round numbers that the meteorites are distributed each 250 miles away from its neighbours.*

*) Article "Meteorites," Professor Newton, _Encyclopædia Britannica_, ninth edition, vol. 16.; and "Abstract of a Memoir on Shooting-Stars," by Professor Newton, _Silliman's Journal_, vol. 39., 1865.

It has already been shown in Chapter 11 that the term "sporadic" was simply a measure of our ignorance; and that when the continuous observation of falling stars was really begun in earnest, the number of constant points from which they emanated was soon mightily increased; the falls thus became systematised, and it was found that the November and August swarms were true types. With every new "radiant" thus established the number of sporadic meteors naturally became less and less.* There will be a further word to be said on this point in the next chapter.

*) It is highly probable that the meteors termed sporadic really belong to systematic showers, which are, however, of extreme tenuity.  There is a vast number of feeble systems of this character, and many of them, being simultaneously in action, gave rise to the discursive flights visible on ordinary nights of the year, and induced the belief that such meteorites were isolated, and mere chance visitors to our atmosphere.  Prolonged observations, chiefly by Mr. Denning, have recently shown that these meteorites may be assigned to their several radiant points, and that as many as fifty or sixty different systems are sometimes in operation on one and the same night.

With regard to the systematic meteorites --- those, namely, that are massed in swarms --- the labours of many observers have already enriched science with a large number of showers, of which the return is periodic; among these may be mentioned the following:---*

*) Denning, _Monthly Notices_, vol. 48. p. 111.

[TABLE]

With regard to these showers much still remains to be done before their density can be stated. Professor Newton has, however, calculated that in the Biela swarm the meteorites are 20 miles apart.

This chapter may fitly conclude by the following notes on the above showers, for them I am chiefly indebted to Mr. Denning ---

_Quadrantids._ --- Heis was the first to determine this radiant accurately. It was subsequently observed by Masters and Professor Herschel (1863-1864). The radiant is circumpolar in this latitude, but low down during the greater part of the night, hence the display is usually seen to the best advantage on the morning of 2d January.

_Lyrids._ --- Attention was first drawn to the April meteors by Herrick in the United States (_B. A. Report_, 1871, p. 42). The probable identity of this meteor orbit with Comet 1, 1861, was pointed out by Galle and Weiss.

_η Aquarids._ --- Further observations are urgently required of this stream. The radiant is only visible for a short time before sunrise. There is a considerable difference between Mr. Denning's results and those secured by Colonel Tupman, the discoverer of this system in 1870, whose observations place the radiant at 326 1/2-2 1/2, 29th April to 3d May.

_δ Aquarids._ --- The meteoric epoch, 26th-30th July, was first pointed out by Quetelet many years ago. Biot also found, from the oldest Chinese observations, a general maximum between 18th and 27th July (Humboldt). Showers of Aquarids were remarked by Schmidt, Tupman (1870), and others, but it was not known until observations in 1878 by Denning that the Aquarids formed the special display of the epoch, and that there were many early Perseids visible at the same time.

_Perseids._ --- Muschenbroeck, in his work on _Natural Philosophy_, printed in 1762, mentions that he observed shooting-stars to be more numerous in August than in the other months of the year. Quetelet, in 1835, was, however, the first to attribute a definite maximum to the 9th-10th. This stream is remarkable for its extended duration, and for the obvious displacement which occurs from night to night in the place of its radiant (see _Monthly Notices_, 45. pp. 97, 98). The period of visibility appears to cover the forty-three nights from 18th July to 22d August inclusive, and the radiant advances from 3° +49° to 76° +57°. This shower apparently varies but little in its annual richness. In the morning of 11th August it usually yields from sixty to eighty meteors per hour for one observer.

_Orionids._ --- Professors Schmidt and Herschel were the first to discover the Orionids as the most brilliant display of the October period, and accurately determined its radiant in 1863-1865. Herrick recorded a shower at 99° +26°, 20th-26th October 1839, and Zezioli in 1868 recorded many meteors which were ascribed to a radiant at 111° +29°, but there is no doubt that the Orionids were observed in both these cases, though the radiant was badly assigned. There is a contemporary shower at 106° +22°, close to _δ Geminorum_, which is liable to be confused with the Orionids, but the latter is by far the richer of the pair. The radiant of the Orionids shows no displacement like the Perseids.

_Leonids._ --- This is the famous November swarm, to which we have sufficiently referred in the text. The last splendid shower was in 1866, 13th November, and many meteors were seen at the few subsequent returns. During the last fifteen years the displays have been extremely meagre. There is no doubt, however, that the meteors form a complete ellipse, for the earth encounters a few of the particles at every passage through the node. It is supposed that there are minor groups of meteors pursuing the same orbit.

_Andromedes._ --- Observed by Brandes, at Hamburg, 7th December 1798. It also recurred in 1838, and was recognised by Zezioli in 1867, and afterwards ascribed by Schiaparelli to its true source in Biela's Comet; the very brilliant showers of 27th November 1872 and 1885 are still fresh in the memory. It is uncertain whether this group forms an unbroken stream; if so, the regions far removed from the comet must be extremely attenuated. Some of the meteors were seen in 1877 and 1879. The radiant is diffuse to the extent of 7° or 10°. The cometary radiant is at 23°.4 +43°.4 (Weiss), and 24° +43°.2 (Corrigan), which is very close to the meteoric centre. Returns of the shower should be looked for in 1892 and 1898.

_Geminids._ --- Mr. Greg first called attention to the importance of this shower. It was well observed by Professor Herschel in 1861-1864, and some later years.

### Chapter 13. These Meteor Swarms are Comets.

The final step taken by Schiaparelli in his investigations was a demonstration that the orbits of certain of these streams or swarms, to which reference has been made, were really identical with the elements of known comets.

Schiaparelli computed the elements of the orbit of the August meteors, supposing them to be moving along a cometary or parabolic orbit. For his calculations the data were the radiant in R. A. 44°, N. Decl. 56°, and the time of the earth passing near the centre of the group in 1866, August 10.75. With the elements thus obtained he found those of the comet, 1862, 3, discovered by Tuttle on 18th July 1862, according to the latest determinations by Oppolzer,* to be nearly identical, as is seen in the following statement: ---

*) _Astr. Nach._, No. 1384.

[TABLE]

As remarked by Professor Newton,* we come thus to the unexpected conclusion _that the comet of 1862 is nothing else than one of the August meteoroids, and probably the largest of them all_.

*) _Silliman's Journal_, vol. 43., 1867.

When this relation of the comet of 1862 with the August meteors was discovered by Schiaparelli, no comet was known having similar relations with the November meteors. Oppolzer, however, shortly after,* published a corrected orbit of comet, 1866, 1, discovered by Tempel in December 1865; and the resemblance of its elements to those of the orbit of the November group was at once obvious, and attracted the attention of several astronomers.* The following table gives the details:---*

*) _Astr. Nach._, No. 1624.

*) Peters, _Astr. Nach._, No. 1624; Oppolzer, _ibid._, No. 1626; Schiaparelli, _ibid._

*) _Bulletino Meteor._, 28th February 1867.

[TABLE]

Tempel's comet has been found not only to describe the same orbit as the November swarm, but to occupy the same portion of the orbit, probably nearer the head than the tail of the swarm. The observations of 13th November 1865 showed that the earth traversed the anterior portion of the swarm at that time. Two months later the cornet passed the node, and ten months afterwards the earth, returning to the node, encountered the dense portion of the stream, which gave rise to the glorious display in 1866, hence the total length of the stream would exceed 500,000,000 miles.

Professor Newton* remarks that the computed elements of the comet of 1366, though very uncertain, resemble those of comet, 1866, 1, and may belong to the same body. There was a remarkable star shower in 1366 shortly after the computed perihelion passage of the comet.

*) _Amer. Journ._, second series, vol. 43. p. 285, 1867.

The comet, 1862, 3 (sometimes called 1862, 2, by not counting Encke's comet), was first remarked in July, and therefore a month before the appearance of its meteors, the Perseids. It was visible more than three months. At its brightest its nucleus was equal to a star of the second or third magnitude, and its tail, according to some observers, was as much as 25° in length.

The minimum distance of Tempel's comet from the earth's orbit was .00660, about two and a half times the distance of the earth from the moon. This distance for Tuttle's comet was .00472 or about 430,000 miles.

Since this discovery of Schiaparelli's, several other star showers have been shown to be due to meteorite swarms pursuing generally elliptic orbits round the sun, which orbits are identical with those of various known cornets. And it is probable that other meteor streams will subsequently be associated with comets.

This work was chiefly done in the first instance by a Committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, who published each year, from 1850 to 1881, a Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, in which were given the times, paths, physical appearances, and other phenomena of meteors seen during the years immediately preceding. Mr. R. P. Greg, assisted by Professor A. S. Herschel, subsequently undertook the task of plotting the paths, and by this means they early determined between fifty and sixty radiants for different periods of the year.

Working on these data, Professor Herschel* in 1878 gave a list of seventy-one instances of approximate agreements between the elements of certain comets and meteor showers, but many of these are likely to be accidental agreements. There are only five cases known in which all the conditions favour the idea of absolute identity, _viz._ ---

*) _Monthly Notices_, vol. 38. 1878.

Although we owe the final demonstration of the meteoritic nature of comets, as we have seen, to the labours of Newton, Adams, and Schiaparelli chiefly, long before their time the connection between shooting-stars (and even meteorites) and comets had been suspected on various grounds.*

*) For many references in what follows I am indebted to the historical notice in Schiaparelli's _Stelle Cadente_, which is certainly one of the most important contributions to astronomical literature which this century has produced.

Many shooting-stars pass through the air with a trail. This appearance is certainly suggestive of a very rapid comet. Hence, perhaps, it was that such an appendage, often noticed in the case of bright meteors, was sometimes described in ancient records as a comet. It is known that Cardano described as a comet the great meteor from which fell 1200 stones on the territory of Crema on 4th September 1511.*

*) Humboldt, _Cosmos_, 4. p. 587 (Otté); Cardano, _Opera_, Lugduni, 1663, t. 3. p. 279; see also Schiaparelli, _Stelle Cadente_.

Not only, as we have seen, did Kepler (1600) regard shooting-stars as akin in nature to meteorites, but he held that both had the same origin as comets ---

Falling stars are composed of inflammatory viscous materials. Some of them disappear during their fall, while others indeed fall to the earth, drawn by their own weight. Nor, indeed, is it improbable that they have been formed into globes from feculent materials mixed with the ethereal air itself, and thrown from the ethereal region in a straight line through the air like very small comets, the cause of the motion of both being hidden.*

*) Kepler, _Opera_, ed. Frisch, vol. 6. p. 157.

Halley (1700), though he thought that the phenomenon of shooting-stars* wras produced by a material disseminated through celestial space falling upon the sun and meeting the earth in its passage, did not associate it with cometary phenomena; but Maskelyne (1765) held that meteors were of celestial origin, and was inclined to assimilate them to comets. He wrote as follows in a letter to the Abbé Cesaris, the astronomer at Milan, about 12th December 1783: "Freely accept, I pray you, this map, which I have lately published in order to stir up learned men rather than the unlearned, to observe more keenly the phenomena called fire-balls. In all probability they will turn out to be comets..."*

*) Coulvier-Gravier et Saigey, _Introd. Historique_, p. 5.

*) _Memorie della Società Italiana_, vol. 3. p. 345, Verona, 1786.

We have already seen that Chladni formulated the view, in 1794, that space is filled with matter. In 1819 he extended it by stating that shooting-stars, meteorites, and comets were but different manifestations of it.*

*) _Über Feuermeteore, und über die mit denselben herabgefallenen Massen_ (Wien, 1819); see also _Über den Ursprung der von Pallas gefundenen Eisenmassen_, p. 24.

Chladni made another step, of which, as pointed out by Schiaparelli, only today are we able to appreciate the importance. In suggesting the cosmical hypothesis, he regarded two possible cases: either the meteors are formed of masses of independent materials which had never constituted part of the larger celestial bodies, or they are the result of the destruction of a celestial body previously existing. Chladni regarded the second hypothesis as possible, but held to the first as more probable. He stated that we could not doubt the existence, in the celestial spaces, of small bodies endowed with movement, which are now and then visible by passing before the sun.

He held, therefore, that the small masses which appear under the forms of bolides and falling stars do not differ essentially from comets. It is also probable, he says, that comets consist of clouds composed in great part of masses of vapour and dust, which are kept together by mutual attraction. That this attraction is not enough to sensibly disturb the planetary movements is a proof of the exceeding tenuity and dispersion of the materials in such clouds, through which, however large, it is possible to observe the fixed stars.*

*) _Feuermeteore_, p. 395; see Kaemtz, _Meteorologie_, vol. 3. p. 316.

In 1839 the Abbé Raillard suggested a connection between luminous meteors and comets and the aurora,* and Dr. Forster noted that the years marked by the appearance of a large comet are remarkable also for the abundance of falling stars, especially of white ones.*

*) _Les Mondes_, t. 12. p. 649, et t. 13. p. 606.

*) _Essai sur l'Influence des Comètes_, _etc._ (Bruges, 1843).

Perhaps the first to give a more solid support to the cometary theory of falling stars on geometric grounds was Boguslawski, who conceived the idea of representing, by means of parabolas, the apparent orbits observed in some of the August meteors of 1837.*

*) Coulvier-Gravier et Saigey, _Introd. Historique_, p. 103.

For the next important advance in thought upon this subject we have to come down to 1858, in which year Baron Reichenbach published a most important memoir* attacking the question from an entirely new point of view. Accepting as proved, by the then knowledge, the most intimate connection between meteorites and falling stars, he argued that both were connected with comets. He first recapitulated the facts then accepted with regard to the latter ---

*) Poggendorff's _Annalen_, vol. 105. p. 438.

1\. Comets, both tail and nucleus are transparent.

2\. Light is transmitted through comets without refraction; hence the cometary substance can be neither gaseous nor liquid.

3\. The light is polarised, and therefore borrowed from the sun.

4\. Comets have no phases like those of moon and planets.

5\. They exercise no perturbing influences.

6\. Donati's comet (which was then visible) in its details and its contour is changing every day --- according to Piazzi, almost hourly.

7\. The density of a comet is extremely small.

8\. The absolute mass is sometimes small (von Littrow having calculated very small comets, tail and all, as scarcely reaching 8 lbs.)

From these data the following conclusions might be drawn:---

1\. That a comet's tail must consist of a swarm of extremely small but solid particles, therefore granules.

2\. That every granule is far away from its neighbour --- in fact, so far that a ray of light may have an uninterrupted course through the swarm.

3\. That these granules, suspended in space, move freely and yield to outer and inner agencies --- agglomerate, condense, or expand; that a comet's nucleus, where one is present, is nothing else than such an agglomeration of loose substances consisting of particles. Hence we must picture a comet as a loose, transparent, illuminated, free-moving swarm of small solid granules suspended in empty space.

The next step in Reichenbach's reasoning was to show that meteorites (of which he had a profound knowledge) were really composed of granules. He pointed out that these granules (since called chondroi) formed really the characteristic structure both of irons and stones, so that both orders were chiefly aggregates of chondroi --- stony ones in iron meteorites, iron ones in stony meteorites. In some irons, such as Zacatecas, they exist as big as walnuts, firmly adherent, but they can be separated; inside these are balls of troilite, often firmly embedded, so that on breaking the meteorite they will divide, but in other cases so loose that they fall out, and they are smooth enough to roll off a table.

Sometimes chondroi have smaller ones sprinkled in them, sometimes dark chondroi have white earthy kernels. In other cases chondroi are so plentiful as to form nearly the whole mass of the meteorite. They are often perfectly round, but not always, and they are often so loose that they tumble out and leave an empty smooth spherical cavity.

The stones chiefly consist of such chondroi and their _débris_.

He adds that each magnesic chondros "is an independent crystallised individual --- it is a stranger in the meteorite. Every chondros was once a complete, independent, though minute meteorite. It is embedded like a shell in limestone. Millions of years may have passed between the formation of the spherule and its embeddal."

The remark is next made that the chondroi of meteorites indicate a condensation of innumerable bodies such as we see must exist in the case of comets; further, that they have been formed in a state of unrest and impact from all sides. Many meteorites are true breccias; they have _many times_ suffered mechanical violence. He adds that in comets we have precisely the conditions where such forces could operate, and hence arrives at the view that "comets and meteorites may be nothing else but one and the same phenomenon."*

*) For this analysis of a part of Reichenbach's memoir, I am indebted to my friend, Mr. L. Fletcher, of the British Museum.

This was in 1858, eight years before Schiaparelli's discovery, which was also very clearly foreshadowed by Kirkwood, who insisted on very definite grounds, as we shall see in the next chapter, upon the identity of comets and falling stars.

It is interesting at this point to inquire what the precise difference between a falling star and a comet was then supposed by astronomers to be. It will be seen that it was vastly different from Reichenbach's. Newton referred the comet of 1862 to the largest meteorite in the August swarm. In 1873 the following views were expressed in the Report of the B. A. Committee on Luminous Meteors:---*

*) Page 399.

The extraordinary meteorological changes which comets undergo from the eccentricities of their orbits may, by the process of a kind of "weathering," disintegrate their surfaces sufficiently to scatter such bodies in crowds along their paths.

In this view, instead of presupposing the existence of cosmical clouds containing all these several bodies separately formed, comets may be regarded as parent bodies from which aërolites and shower-meteors are similarly derived. Adopting a special theory of the origin and of the physical constitution of comets, Zöllner explains the production of such star-showers as that which was witnessed last November, by a process very similar to the last.*

*) F. Zöllner, _Über den Zusammenhang von Sternschnuppen und Cometen_. Poggendorff's _Annals_, vol. 148. pp. 322-329. See also _Über die Natur der Cometen_ (Leipzig, 1872), by the same author, p. 109.

Supposing the remnants of a shattered star or planet to be scattered by some catastrophe into interstellar space, besides the materials of aëorlites and detonating fire-balls which would result, it may be assumed that fluid masses, as of their seas (and possibly hydrocarbons) and other easily volatilisable substances would occur among the _débris_ of such a shock. Among the fluids and easily vaporisable materials thus ushered into space, and there maintained as liquids or solids by cold, and by their own attractions, the sun's heat acting upon their otherwise fixed masses, when first drawn into its immediate neighbourhood, would effect a surface distillation sufficiently abundant to detach some vaporous portions from their spheres, or even to volatilise them completely, and to efface them, after many periodic revolutions, from the sky. These vapours might possibly re-condense afterwards into solid dust or drops, to assume the form of meteor swarms along the cometary orbit, producing on their collision with the earth's atmosphere the extraordinary phenomena of star showers.*

*) That even mineral substances are gradually volatilised at comparatively low temperatures, and sublime or are recondensed in appreciable quantities, is shown by some remarkable experiments by the Rev. W. Vernon Harcourt on various minerals placed for many years under the hearth of an iron smelting furnace, as described in the volume of these Reports for 1860, p. 175 _et seq._ (with coloured plates).  Under the action of a prolonged heat, in which neither copper, zinc, lead, nor tin were fused, the oxide of copper which formed a crust upon the plate of that metal had sublimed, and deposited itself in red crystals along with sublimed metallic copper, not only upon the surface, but also in the interior of the neighbouring piece of lead. The adjacent pieces of the other metals were similarly calcined, and coated with a thick crystalline crust of their oxides which had diffused itself in a similar manner among the substances of the surrounding blocks (see the explanation of the experiments and of the plates at pp. 188 and 192 of that Report).

We may infer from the work which has already been done that Reichenbach's view is more probably the true one, and that the head of a comet is merely the denser part of a swarm. Whether that denser part is at the end or at the beginning of the long line to which reference has been made, it does not very much matter, but where that is, there we shall have the appearance of a comet presented to us in the heavens. We, indeed, are not limited to the supposition that there is only one dense part in a swarm; there is evidence to the contrary supplied both by falling stars and comets.

The November swarm orbit has in all probability two maxima.* Professor Kirkwood pointed out in 1875 that the dates of certain meteoric showers, given by Humboldt and Quetelet as belonging to the November stream, indicate the existence of two distinct and widely separated clusters moving in orbits very nearly identical. The years thus designated were 1787, 1818, 1820, 1822, 1823, 1841, and 1846. He writes ---

*) Luminous Meteor Report, 1876, pp. 224, 225.

As the last two were subsequent to the great display of 1833, the meteors seen were noticed only in consequence of their being specially looked for; and as the number conformable to the radiant of the Leonids is not given, there may be some doubt whether those observed really belonged to the November stream. The former displays occurred before the periodicity of such phenomena had been suspected, and the number of meteors would seem to have been considerable. As the shower of 1787 preceded by twelve years the great meteoric fall witnessed in South America by Humboldt, the group from which it was derived had passed beyond the orbit of Saturn at the time of the latter display. The phenomena of 1818, 1820, 1822, and 1823 indicate that, as in the case of the major group, which passed its descending node between 1865 and 1870, the meteoroids are extended over a considerable arc of their orbit. From November 1787 to the middle of the nodal passage of 1818-1823 is about 33 1/3 years --- a period nearly the same as that of the principal cluster. These facts alone were regarded by the present writer as giving reasonable probability to the hypothesis of an approximate identity of orbits. In _Nature_, vol. 11. p. 407, it was shown that the meteor showers of October 855 and 856 were probably derived from the stream of Leonids; and it is certainly remarkable that the interval from 855 to 1787 is equal to twenty-eight periods of 33.293 years. Again the shower observed in China, 28th September, 288 A. D., making proper allowance for the nodal motion, corresponds to the same epoch, the interval between 288 and 855 containing seventeen periods of 33.35 years.

Several instances are known in which, in like manner, there are two comets pursuing the same path.

The demonstration of the identity of meteor swarms and comets is one of the greatest physical triumphs of the century. From the point of view of this book it is of fundamental importance, because it enables us to apply everything that we have learned about comets to the movements of meteorites in space; while in the case of meteors and falling stars we were limited to what took place in our own air.
