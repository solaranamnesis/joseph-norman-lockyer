# Preface.

This volume has for its object the bringing together and coordinating of the observations which have been made up to the present time on the spectra of the various orders of cosmical bodies, in connection with laboratory work on which I have been engaged since 1868. It embodies in a connected form, among other matters, various Reports presented by me to the Solar Physics Committee, and subsequently communicated to the Royal Society; the President of the latter body having given me permission to utilise them as I have done in the present publication.

The work now considered follows logically upon researches which suggested that many solar phenomena might owe their origin to the falls of meteoritic masses upon the sun's surface. This subject I dealt with in a former book, _The Chemistry of the Sun_, published in 1887, to which, in fact, the present volume is the natural sequel.

Since the book has been in type, advances have been made in several of the lines of inquiry touched upon --- the photographic study of nebular spectra may be cited as an instance --- which I should have gladly included; but as no new point of theoretical importance has been raised, I have thought it better not to delay publication in order to treat them in detail.

It may be that I should have added a final chapter, giving an account of the objections raised to the views here expressed. I have not done this because such objections as have been formulated have dealt only with small details of no fundamental importance for the hypothesis as a whole; and because, so far, it has been difficult for any one to deal with the hypothesis in its generality, in consequence of the number of separate memoirs in which the results obtained from time to time have been published.

It is not in the nature of things that a large mass of detailed work and inquiry which has taken my assistants and myself three years to get together shall be found free from error, especially since observations made by many men in many lands, frequently under conditions of great difficulty, form part of the basis of the discussion. Nor, again, is it likely or even desirable that the general hypothesis, if it be found of any value at all, shall not be improved when fresh minds are brought to bear upon it.

When the time arrives, I shall profit more than any one else by any valid objections that may be raised, and I shall be careful to reply to or accept them.

As the work proceeded many crucial tests were found, _e. g._ in the so-called continuous spectrum of some nebulae, the spectra of bright-line stars, and the differentiation of stars of Vogel's Class 2a into two groups, for which a telescope of large aperture was essential. In the body of the work I express my obligations to Mr. Common, F. R. S., and the Brothers Henry, of the Paris Observatory, for the assistance they have rendered in enabling me to apply the tests in question.

My thanks are due in this place to Professor A. S. Herschel, F. R. S., who permitted me to consult him on the early portions of the book dealing with luminous meteors, and was kind enough to look over the proofs; and also to Mr. Knott, who has freely permitted me to draw on his knowledge of the phenomena of variable stars.

I must also express my obligations to Mr. Roberts for generously permitting me to reproduce some of his marvellous photographs of nebulae, and to Professor Pickering for forwarding to me some of the equally wonderful photographs of stellar spectra, which worthily form the basis of the Draper Memorial.

Among the assistants, on whose skill and industry I have relied for carrying out the details of the various investigations and the general reductions of observations, I must first mention Mr. Fowler, the Demonstrator of Astronomical Physics in the Normal School, whose aid has been quite invaluable, and whose keen interest in the work has never flagged. To Messrs. Taylor and Gregory I have chiefly looked for bringing together the work done at other observatories which has been discussed in this volume. Different branches of the laboratory and observatory work have fallen at different times upon Messrs. Atkins, Spencer, Porter, Baxandall, Coppen, and Sergeant Kearney, R. E.

# Part 1. The Fall and Nature of Meteorites.

## Chapter 1. Ancient and Modern Records of Falls.

Although Natural Science as a whole is a product of the modern world, this is by no means true of all branches of it; in some, by diving into the history of the past, we become acquainted with the phenomena which most forcibly impressed early man, and the effect produced by them on his mind.

Such an historical retrospect is of special interest in connection with the subject-matter of this book, for we learn from it that the falls of "stones from heaven" have been as constant in times past as in times present, and we are brought face to face with the stupendous awe inspired among whole peoples by what were considered to be omens coming visibly and directly from the Immortal Gods. The word omen really understates the old belief, for in many cases meteorites were placed in temples and regarded as the impersonations of the deities, even in Greece as well as in the East. In the temple of Aphrodite at Paphos and in that of Apollo at Delphi a conical stone stood in the place of an image; these were in all probability meteorites like the image at Ephesus, mentioned by St. Paul.

The earliest fall recorded in the annals of the Western world dates from 1478 B. C. It happened in Crete, but the record is much more doubtful than that of the falls in 705 and 654 B. C., noted, the first by Plutarch, and the second by Livy.

But it is agreed on all hands that the first fall to which the greatest interest attaches was observed in the Thracian Chersonesus, on the banks of the river Ægospotamos, 468 B. C. Aristotle, Plutarch, Pliny,* and other ancient authors refer to the circumstances of the fall, which are also recorded in the Parian chronicle engraved on marble, which is now one of the glories of the University Galleries at Oxford.* This meteorite was as large as two millstones. It is noteworthy that in connection with it Anaxagoras was accused of having predicted the fall of this and others from the sun, which he regarded as a molten fiery mass.*

*) _N. H._ vol. 2. p. 59.

*) I learn from Professors Pritchard and Gardner that the upper half of the marble slab disappeared at Arundel House many years ago.  The remaining part is so damaged by weather and probably by fire that no intelligible photograph of any part of it could be taken. A transcription of the marble, made when it was far better preserved, is given in Boeckh's _Corpus Inscriptionum Græcorum_, vol. 2. p. 293, 2374.

*) _Cosmos_, Otté's translation, vol. 1. p. 110.

Whatever its origin, it was held in veneration by the Thracians, and the subsequent defeat of the Athenians in the neighbourhood was attributed to its virtues. Humboldt relates that the African traveller Brown made a journey to Thrace to find it, but without success.

M. Daubrée, in his volume on the _Interior of the Earth_,* has collected together much interesting information relating to the next great historic fall --- that at Pessinuntia in Phrygia in 264 B. C. This became the object of a special cult --- that of Cybele, the mother of the gods. The Decemviri, charged with the custody of the Sibylline leaves, declared that the presence of the stone would bring about the expulsion of the Carthaginians from Italy, and with the consent of Attala it was brought to Rome with splendid pomp, which clearly indicates to us how firmly its divine nature and origin were believed in. The oracle of Delphi, on being consulted, declared that the most honest man should take charge of it. The Senate having declared that Scipio Nasica was that man, he proceeded to Ostia amidst general rejoicing and accompanied by a train of noble Roman ladies, who in turn bore it back to its appointed resting-place, the Temple of Victory. The stone itself was small and black, and had been mounted in silver; the visible part bore a resemblance to a human face.

*) _Régions invisibles du Globe et des Espaces célestes_, International Scientific Series, p. 150.

The above instances --- they might be considerably multiplied--- will give an idea of the belief firmly held by the ancients that meteorites were of non-terrestrial origin, and of the superstitious veneration accorded to them in consequence.

A perusal of the Chinese annals --- which reach back to the year 644 before our era, and are still models of patient record --- shows also in the most definite manner that since the very commencement of human history, in the East as well as in the West, falls of bodies on to the earth from external space have been noticed. Biot has traced in Ma-tuan-lin the record of sixteen falls from the date before mentioned to 333 A. D.

Many meteorites fell during the Middle Ages, but they were no longer regarded as celestial omens, though they were considered worthy of the notice of emperors. One that fell in 1492 at Ensisheim in Alsace was, by the orders of the Emperor Maximilian, hung in the church by an iron chain, and it is still preserved in the town hall.

In more modern times, naturally a keener and more intelligent observation, combined with a larger inhabited area, has largely increased the number of recorded falls. It will be sufficient if we here refer to some that have fallen in Britain.

The first is stated to have occurred in 1622 in Devonshire. The second in 1628 in Berkshire. The circumstances of this latter fall are recorded in a very rare tract, a copy of which is in the British Museum; its title runs ---

Looke Vp and See Wonders: a miraculous Apparition in the Ayre, lately seen in Barke-shire at Bawlkin Greene, neere Hatford, 9th April 1628. (Imprinted at London for Roger Mitchell.)

It begins as follows ---

So Benummed wee are in our Sences, that albeit God himselfe Holla in our Eares, wee by our Wills are loath to heare him. His dreadfull Pursiuants of _Thunder_ and _Lightning_ terrifie vs so long as they have vs in their fingers, but beeing off, wee dance and sing in the midst of our Follies.

Then, proceeding to his task, the author tells how

the foure great quarter-masters of the World (_the foure Elements_)... have bin in ciuill warres one against another... As for Fire, it hath denied of late to warme vs, but at vnreasonable rates, and extreame hard conditions. But what talke I of this earthy nourishment of _fire_? How have the _Fires_ of Heaven (some few years past) gone beyond their bounds, and appeared in the shapes of Comets and Blazing Starres?... The _Aire_ is the shop of Thunder and Lightning. In that, hath of late bin held a Muster of terrible enemies* and threatners of Vengeance, which the great Generall of the Field, who Conducts and Commands all such Armies (_God Almighty, I meane_) auert from our Kingdome, and shoote the arrowes of his indignation some other way, upon the bosomes of those that would confound his Gospell... Many windowes hath he set open in Heaven, to shewe what Artillery hee has lying there, and many of our Kings have trembled, when they were shewne vnto them. What blazing Starres (euen at Noone-dayes) in those times hung houering in the Aire? How many frightfull Ecclipses both of Sun and Moone?... It is not for man to dispute with God, why he has done this so often... but, with feare and trembling casting our eyes vp to Heauen, let us now behold him, bending his Fist onely, as lately he did to the terrour and affrightment of all the Inhabitants dwelling within a Towne in the County of Barkshire... The name of the Towne is _Hatford_, some eight miles from _Oxford_. Ouer this Towne, vpon Wensday being the ninth of this instant Moneth of _April_ 1628, about five of the clocke in the afternoone this miraculous, prodigious, and fearefull handyworke of God was presented... The weather was warme, and without any great shewe of distemperature, only the skye waxed by degrees a little gloomy, yet not so darkened but that the Sunne still and anon, by the power of the brightnesse, brake through the thicke clouds...

*) Dr. Flight thus describes the vignette: "The quaint vignette of this pamphlet gives such a graphic and awe-inspiring representation of 'heaven's artillery' as would strike terror even into Petruchio's heart. The heavens are depicted laid out as a scroll; and, with hurricanes blowing, drums beating, and demi-culverins and sakers discharging meteorites, we witness the airy armies 'grappling in the central blue.'"

A gentle gale of wind then blowing from betweene the West and North-west, in an instant was heard, first a hideous rumbling in the _Ayre_, and presently after followed a strange and feare-full peal of Thunder, running up and downe these parts of the Countrey, but it strake with the loudest violence, and more furious tearing of the _Ayre_, about a place called _The White Horse Hill_, than in any other. The whole order of this thunder carried a kind of Maiesticall state with it, for it maintayned (to the offrighted Beholders' seeming) the fashion of a fought Battaile.

It beganne thus: First, for an onset, went off one great Cannon as it were of _thunder_ alone, like a warning peece to the rest that were to follow. Then a little while after was heard a second; and so by degrees a third, vntill the number of 20 were discharged (or there-abouts) in very good order, though in very great terror.

In some little distance of time after this was audibly heard the sound of a Drum beating a Retreate. Amongst all these angry peales shot off from Heauen, this begat a wonderful admiration, that at the end of the report of euery cracke, or _Cannon-thundering_, a hizzing Noyse made way through the _Ayre_, not unlike the flying of _Bullets_ from the mouthes of great Ordnance; and by the judgment of all the terror-striken witnesses they were _Thunder-bolts_. For one of them was seene by many people to fall at a place called Bawlkin Greene, being a mile and a half from Hatford: Which _Thunder-bolt_ was by one Mistris _Greene_ caused to be digged out of the ground, she being an eye-witnesse, amongst many other, of the manner of the falling.

The form of the _Stone_ is three-square, and picked in the end: In colour outwardly blackish, somewhat like Iron: crusted over with that blacknesse about the thicknesse of a shilling. Within it is a soft, of a gray colour, mixed with some kind of minerall, shining like small peeces of glasse.*

*) Of the stones which fell at Siena, Italy, on the 16th of June 1794, one is thus described: "Von Aussen war er schwarz, wie eine Kohle, inwendig aschgrau, und mit Stücken von Metall vermengt." --- Von Ende, _Massen und Steine_, _etc._, p. 50.

This _Stone_ brake in the fal: The whole peece is in weight nineteene pound and a halfe: The greater peece that fell off weigheth five pound, which with other small peeces being put together, make foure and twenty pound and better...

It is in the Countrey credibly reported that some other Thunder-stones* have bin found in other places: But for certainty there was one tapen vp at _Letcombe_, and is now in the custody of the _Shriefe_.

*) Dr. Flight is of opinion that this is the earliest use of this term, which is found in the beautiful song of "Guiderius and Arviragus," _Cymbeline_, Act 4. Scene 2.

About the beginning of the present century other falls were recorded in these islands.

In England there fell a stone in the afternoon of 13th December 1795. A labourer happened to be working near Wold Cottage, Thwing, Yorkshire, when this stone fell within a few yards of him. On digging the stone out of the ground it was found to have penetrated a foot of soil and half a foot of chalk rock, and to weigh 56 lb. The inhabitants of the neighbouring villages likened the explosion to the firing of guns at sea, while in two of them the sounds were so distinct of something rushing through the air towards Wold Cottage that some of the people went to see if anything extraordinary had happened.

The next account is from Ireland. It is the narrative of an eyewitness of a fall of meteorites in the county of Limerick.

Friday morning, the 10th of September 1813, being very calm and serene, and the sky clear, about nine o'clock, a cloud appeared in the east, and very soon after I heard eleven distinct reports appearing to proceed thence, somewhat resembling the discharge of heavy artillery. Immediately after this followed a considerable noise not unlike the beating of a large drum, which was succeeded by an uproar resembling the continued discharge of musketry in line. The sky above the place whence this noise appeared to issue became darkened and very much disturbed, making a hissing noise, and from thence appeared to issue with great violence different masses of matter, which directed their course with great velocity in a horizontal direction towards the west. One of these was observed to descend; it fell to the earth, and sank into it more than a foot and a half, on the lands of Scagh, in the neighbourhood of Patrick's Well, in the county of Limerick. It was immediately dug up, and I have been informed by those that were present, and on whom I could rely, that it was then warm and had a sulphurous smell. It weighed about 17 lb., and had no appearance of having been fractured in any part, for the whole of its surface was uniformly smooth and black, as if affected by sulphur or gunpowder. Six or seven more of the same kind of masses, but smaller, and fractured, as if shattered from each other or from larger ones, descended at the same time with great velocity in different places between the lands of Scagh and the village of Adare. One more very large mass passed with great rapidity and considerable noise at a small distance from me; it came to the ground on the lands of Brasky, and penetrated a very hard and dry earth about 2 feet. This was not taken up for two days; it appeared to be fractured in many places, and weighed about 65 lb.! Its shape was rather round, but irregular. It cannot be ascertained whether the small fragments which came down at the same time corresponded with the fractures of this large stone in shape or number, but the unfractured part of the surface has the same appearance as the one first mentioned. There fell also at the same time, on the lands of Faha, another stone, which does not appear to have been part of or separated from any other mass; its skin is smooth and blackish, of the same appearance with the first mentioned; it weighed about 74 lb.; its shape was very irregular, for its volume was very heavy... It was about 3 miles in a direct line from the lands of Brasky, where the very large stone descended, to the place where the small ones fell in Adare, and all the others fell intermediately; but they appeared to descend horizontally, and as if discharged from a bomb and scattered in the air.*

*) Quoted by Maskelyne, "Lecture Notes on Meteorites," _Nature_, 1875, vol. 12. p. 485.

Among the most trustworthy records of falls in more recent years are the following. The first deals with the fall of the meteorite of 1885, near Mazapil, in Mexico.  It was thus described by an eyewitness vouched for by Professor Bonilla* ---

*) _Nature_, vol. 35. p. 572.

It was about nine in the evening when I went to the corral to feed certain horses, when suddenly I heard a loud hissing noise, exactly as though something red-hot was being plunged into cold water, and almost instantly there followed a somewhat loud thud. At once the corral was covered with a phosphorescent light, and suspended in the air were small luminous sparks as though from a rocket. I had not recovered from my surprise when I saw this luminous air disappear, and there remained on the ground only such a light as is made when a match is rubbed. A number of people from the neighbouring houses came running toward me, and they assisted me to quiet the horses, which had become very much excited. We all asked each other what could be the matter, and we were afraid to walk in the corral for fear of getting burned. When, in a few moments, we had recovered from our surprise, we saw the phosphorescent light disappear, little by little, and when we had brought lights to look for the cause, we found a hole in the ground and in it a ball of fire. We retired to a distance, fearing it would explode and harm us. Looking up to the sky we saw from time to time exhalations or stars, which soon went out, but without noise.* We returned after a little, and found in the hole a hot stone, which we could barely handle, which on the next day we saw looked like a piece of iron; all night it rained stars, but we saw none fall to the ground, as they seemed to be extinguished while still very high up.

*) The meteorite fell during a star shower.

The next record of the phenomena attending a fall in the United States (though the observer quoted did not actually see the fall) is taken from a lecture by Professor Newton* ---

*) _Nature_, vol. 19. p. 315.

The observers (he says) who stood near to the line of the meteor's flight, were quite overcome with fear, as it seemed to come down upon them with a rapid, increase of size and brilliancy, many of them wishing for a place of safety, but not having the time to seek one. In this fright the animals took a part, horses shying, rearing, and plunging to get away, and dogs retreating and barking with signs of fear. The meteor gave out several marked flashes in its course, one more noticeable than the rest... Thin clouds of smoke and vapour followed in the track of the meteor... From one and a half to two minutes after the dazzling, terrifying, and swiftly moving mass of light had extinguished itself in five sharp flashes, five quickly recurring reports were heard. The volume of sound was so great that the reverberations seemed to shake the earth to its foundations; buildings quaked and rattled, and the furniture that they contained jarred about as if shaken by an earthquake; in fact, many believed that an earthquake was in progress. Quickly succeeding, and blended with the explosions, came hollow bellowings and rattling sounds, mingled with clang, and clash, and roar, that rolled away southward, as if a tornado of fearful power was retreating upon the meteor's path.

About 800 lb. of stones, nearly 200 in number, have been picked up in a region 7 miles by 4, a little east of the end of the meteor's path, which without any doubt came from the meteor. Some were picked up on the surface of the frozen ground. One was found on the top of a snow-bank, and about 40 feet away were marks of a place where it had first struck the ground. Some were ploughed up in the spring. The two largest found, of 74 lb. and 48 lb., fell by the roadside, and a lawsuit to settle whether they were the property of the finder as being wild game, or of the owner of the lands adjacent as being real estate, was decided in favour of the owner of the land.

## Chapter 2. The Physical Characteristics of Meteorites.

The first thing that strikes every one on looking for the first time at a collection of meteorites is that their general form has the character of being fragmentary, so that the idea is suggested that each meteorite is the result of a fracture.

The next point observed is that there is a very great difference between the interior and exterior appearances of these bodies. That this is due to the heat and friction to which the exterior surface has been exposed in its passage through the air, frequently at a very high velocity, is proved by what was noticed in the case of a meteorite that fell at Butsura in 1861. Fragments of this stone were picked up 3 or 4 miles apart, and, with the exception of one corner, the original meteorite has been built up again by piecing the fragments together. The faces fit perfectly. Important pieces of this meteorite are in the British Museum, and these are all coated with the crust, to which reference will be made. But, on the other hand, another of these fragments _not coated_ fits another also not coated. Hence, to quote Professor Maskelyne ---

We can assert that this aërolite acquired, after coming into our atmosphere, a scoriated and blackened surface or incrustation. The first explosion drove the fragments first alluded to asunder, and these became at once incrusted on their broken surfaces; but others which were separated afterwards, probably on the last of the three explosions, had not sufficient velocity left [the heat being at the same time reduced] to cause their incrustation in the same manner as was the case with the fragments previously severed.*

*) "On the Structure and Origin of Meteorites," _Nature_, vol. 15. p. 495.

The supposition is that the temperature is practically high enough to melt the meteorite, and that its surface as we see it after it has fallen does not in all cases represent the surface exposed to the air during the whole of the flight, but that it represents the last surface. The meteorite may have been twenty times bigger, but the rest may have been melted-off like tallow would be, so that finally there is very little visible effect towards the interior, as the melting is more rapid than the conduction. The thinness of the so-called crust or varnish, then, is caused by the air molecules carrying away the results of fusion as fast as the heat penetrates towards the interior, so leaving only, as a rule, a very thin film behind.

[Fig. 1. --- Mazapil Meteoric Iron (3/4 natural size), showing Thumb-Marks.]()

This crust is usually dull, but sometimes, as in the Stannern meteorite, bright and shining, like a coating of black varnish. Sorby,* on examining with a microscope a thin section of a meteorite, cut perpendicular to the crust, found that it is a true black glass filled with small bubbles, and that the contrast between it and the main mass of the meteorite is as complete as possible, the junction between them being sharply defined, except when portions have been injected a short distance between the crystals. He writes ---

*) "Lecture Notes," _loc. cit._ p. 487.

We thus have a most complete proof of the conclusion that the black crust was due to the true igneous fusion of the surface under conditions which had little or no influence at a greater depth than 1/100 of an inch. In the case of meteorites of different chemical composition, the black crust has not retained a true glassy character, and is sometimes 1/50 of an inch in thickness, consisting of two very distinct layers, the internal showing particles of iron which have been neither melted nor oxidised, and the external showing that they have been oxidised and the oxide melted up with the surrounding stony matter. Taking everything into consideration, the microscopical structure of the crust agrees perfectly well with the explanation usually adopted, but rejected by some authors, that it was formed by the fusion of the external surface, and was due to 'the very rapid heating which takes place when a body moving with planetary velocity rushes into the earth's atmosphere --- a heating so rapid that the surface is melted before the heat has time to penetrate beyond a very short distance into the interior of the mass.

In some cases close under the crust is found a mixture of the minerals troilite, asmanite, and bronzite, of an unaltered light brown colour, although they turn deep black when raised to a temperature slightly above that at which lead melts.*

*) Flight, _History of Meteorites_, p. 169.
 The crust or varnish of the meteorite in many cases contains numerous furrows and ridges, so that it is not equally thick. This effect is caused, as it is supposed, by its motion through the air in a fixed position, the forward part of the meteorite, in regard to its line of motion, being most liquefied, and the liquid flowing unequally towards the hinder part.

A very special study of the results of the passage through the air is a desideratum. Thus, in the case of the Tennessee iron, which fell without sign of explosion, and therefore probably with a low velocity, the outer surface is elaborately reticulated, edges of thin laminae of metal inclined at angles of 60° traversing it. Hence no fusion of the superficial layer took place.*

*) Flight, _History of Meteorites_, p. 108.

Another peculiarity of the surface is that it is generally covered with small depressions called "thumb-marks," as they have been likened to the impressions that one makes when pressing some such substance as putty with the thumb or finger. The cause of these marks is unknown, but they have been found to bear a close resemblance to the irregular depressions which have been noticed on grains of gunpowder blown out on firing large guns.

A possible cause of these pittings is thus suggested by Professor Maskelyne ---

The aerolite comes into our atmosphere from regions in which the temperature --- "the cold of space" --- may range as low as 140° C. below zero, and though the mass, from the absorption of solar heat, would possess a temperature much above this, it would nevertheless be intensely cold, and consequently more brittle than at ordinary temperatures; and hence, on its entering our atmosphere, the heat it instantaneously acquires on its outer portion expands this, and tends to tear it away, so as to dissever the exterior from the interior, which continues to be relatively contracted by the intensity of the cold which the aërolite brings with it from space. The consequence is, first, that little bits of the stone spring out all over it, leaving those curious little holes or pit-marks which are characteristic of a meteorite; and every now and then, as the heat penetrates, larger masses split away, of which interesting evidence is afforded by the meteorite, for instance, that fell at Butsura on 12th May 1861.

On this it may be remarked that the pittings are common to irons and stones, while the above explanation only applies to stones.

It is not a little worthy of notice that the pitting does not always appear on all the surfaces. In the case of a meteorite which fell in Kentucky in 1877, one portion of it is very extensively and regularly pitted, while the rest is comparatively smooth. The crust is dull black, and is as perfect as when the stone fell. There was a fresh broken spot of two or three square centimetres, which was evidently made prior to the fall, for a few small specks of the melted matter adhered to the surface.*

*) _Ibid._ p. 200.

These meteorites, which we can thus examine, are in all probability, for the most part, remnants of larger bodies which had enough substance in them to stand the wear and tear of getting through our atmosphere.

The fragments picked up even from the most extensive falls have appeared to those who have witnessed, or who have subsequently studied, the phenomena, to be strangely small in comparison to the violence and magnitude of the apparent explosion and the luminous effects observed.

Some of the startling results produced by the passage of meteorites through the air have already been referred to in the last chapter. They include terrific noises, sometimes like the loudest thunder and at others the booming of distant guns, or even rifle-fire. Clouds are seen suddenly produced in a clear sky, long luminous trails are seen, and in some cases the light produced is so intense as to be seen in broad daylight.

The intensity of all these phenomena may safely be attributed to the enormous velocity with which the meteorites reach the earth's atmosphere. This and the consequent effect upon the meteorites themselves we must now briefly discuss.

In some cases of observed falls the rate of movement of the meteorite through the air has been determined, or concomitant circumstances have enabled it to be roughly estimated. The velocities have been widely different. Before they are stated, some terms of comparison may be given ---

|Metres per second.|Miles an hour.  
Railway trains|27 nearly|60  
Flight of swallow|30 to 40|67 to 92  
Projectiles|300 to 400|670 to 920  
Sound|335 1/3 nearly|750  
Mercury, Movement in Orbit|48,900|109,358  
Venus, Movement in Orbit|36,780|83,162  
Earth, Movement in Orbit|30,430|68,052  
Mars, Movement in Orbit|24,650|55,135  

The highest velocity of flight through the air has been that of the Stannern meteorites, 45 miles a second. The lower part of the flight of the Iowa meteorite was performed at 12 miles a second.

In only a few cases have the velocities been observed to be very great at the earth's surface, the retarding effect of the passage through the atmosphere being considerable. Some have buried themselves deeply in the ground, and one (New Concord) broke a railway-sleeper. Several meteorites have fallen so rapidly that the sound of the explosion _followed_ them. But generally the rate is so slow that they are not broken on striking the surface, and some that fell at Hessle on ice only rebounded without cracking it.

A complete explanation of the origin of the concomitant phenomena so universally recorded is not without its difficulties. M. Daubrée some time ago called in question the explosion hypothesis which has been so generally accepted, and Mr. Hirn has recently given attention to this problem, endeavouring to show that the conditions are similar to those present when thunder is produced by the rapid passage of a flash of lightning.

He writes* ---

*) _Nature_, vol. 35. p. 304.

The sound which we call thunder is due, as everybody knows, to the fact that the air traversed by an electric spark, that is, a flash of lightning, is suddenly raised to a very high temperature, and has its volume moreover considerably increased. The column of gas thus suddenly heated and expanded is sometimes several miles long; as the duration of the flash is not even a millionth of a second, it follows that the noise bursts forth at once from the whole column; but for an observer in any one place it commences where the lightning is at the least distance. In precise terms, the beginning of the thunderclap gives us the minimum distance of the lightning; and the length of the thunderclap gives us the length of the column. It must be remarked that when a flash of lightning strikes the ground, it is not necessarily from the place struck that the first noise is heard.

We have already seen that meteorites penetrate the air with a velocity of 40,000 or even 60,000 metres per second. With that velocity the air is at once raised to a temperature of from 4000° to 6000° C. Because the meteorite is travelling at a velocity about fifty times greater than that of the air molecules themselves, the result is that there is a tremendous crowding of air, so to speak, in front of the meteorite, a tremendous pressure, and therefore a tremendous temperature brought about by its passage. There is a partial vacuum behind, which subsequently has to be filled up by the transit of the molecules round the meteorite itself from the front part to the back.

We have therefore conditions for producing most violent action upon the meteorite, both by pressure and temperature; it may be crushed by the pressure to which it is subjected; it may be melted by the heat produced by the circulation of the molecules rushing past it. We may therefore have violent incandescence and explosion, and as we have the air molecules rushing violently from front to rear, we shall have almost the noise of a thunderstorm added to the sudden luminosity resembling lightning. The matter on the surface of the meteorite will be torn away by the violence of the gaseous friction produced, and will be vaporised at the same time by the heat. This is undoubtedly the origin of the smoke which meteorites leave trailing behind them.

We have, then, precisely as in the case of lightning, a long narrow column of air, which is expanded; not so instantaneously certainly as by lightning, but at all events in an extremely short time and through a great length. Under these circumstances we should have the production of sound in the one case as in the other: a clap of thunder followed by a rolling noise more or less prolonged. Hence we need not regard an actual explosion as necessary to produce the noise generally heard.

Projectiles from guns whistle; but if a cannon-ball could have imparted to it a velocity of 100,000 metres per second, it would no longer whistle --- it would thunder; and at the same time it would produce a flash, as of lightning, and would be speedily burnt up.

The observers of actual falls have heard other special noises, not like thunder, due to the rapid passage of the meteorites through the air --- from the whistle or "ping" of a rifle bullet to the hum of a locomotive --- sounds which have been likened to the tearing of linen, the lowing of cattle, or the flapping of wings.

These sounds have been heard when the meteorite, travelling with greatly reduced velocity, has nearly reached the earth's surface. They are due to the fact that the air, rapidly pushed on one side in front of the projectile (whether bullet or meteorite), quickly rushes back to fill the gap left in the rear.

We can best study the differences in the structure of meteorites by preparing polished sections. In some cases these have a distinctly metallic look. We find, in fact, metallic fragments composed almost entirely of iron, but with a certain amount of nickel.

The nickel in the iron meteorites causes them to have a whitish appearance, and it is from this cause that they have been mistaken for silver when found, the nickel preventing the outer surfaces from rusting as is the case with ordinary iron.

By taking a polished section, and exposing it to the action of an acid or bromine, we obtain what have been called the "figures of Widmanstätten." These figures are more or less complicated, and remarkable for their extreme regularity; they are due to the inequality of the action of the acid on the various constituents of the polished surface; these being various alloys of iron and nickel.

In other specimens the characteristic is that the metal, instead of being continuous as in those previously referred to, appears to have existed once as a spongy paste, and to have included fragments of stony matter, so that in the section, instead of getting the pure metallic lustre all along, we only get it here and there. We pass from metal to metal _plus_ stone.

In yet other specimens we get another generic case represented in which the stone is the main point and the metal the exception, the metal appearing as excessively small granules; so that in the final term of the series we come to almost pure stone, with no iron to speak of.

In the case of the stones, not only does the meteorite itself give the idea of a fragment, as in the case of the irons, but the internal structure of many of them shows that the whole meteorite is composed of fragments, giving the characteristics of a brecciated rock, that is, one made up of pieces cemented together.

Further, these constituent particles, as pointed out by Sorby, are often themselves mere fragments, although the entire body, before being broken, may originally have been only 1/40 or 1/50 of an inch in diameter.

On examining thin sections of stony meteorites by means of polarised light, they are found to be crystallised throughout, the interference tints colouring the different crystals of which the sections are composed, thus showing the crystalline character of the whole. The stony part of both siderolites and aërolites is almost entirely crystalline, and presents a peculiar "chondritic" structure, which makes meteorites differ from ordinary terrestrial rocks; the loose grains are found to be more or less aggregated into little spherules, and to be of similar minerals to those which enclose them.

[Fig. 2. --- Section of Mazapil Meteoric Iron (natural size), showing Widmanstätten Figures.]()

These spherules, or chondroi --- their sizes varying very considerably, some of them being seen only under a microscope, while others are as large as a cherry --- are found embedded in a matrix, made up, as it appears, of minute splinters such as would result from the disintegration of other chondroi.

While the chondroi in terrestrial rocks, such as perlite, obsidian, pitchstone, and many diorites, are radiate-fibrous, those occurring in meteorites are but rarely so, and the arrangement of the fibres within the spherule is eccentric. While the meteoritic chondroi also consist of the same ingredients as the matrix, and often differ from it only in being more coarsely granular, the chondroi of terrestrial rocks are differently constituted from the matrix.*

*) Professor Story Maskelyne, _Nature_, vol. 12. p. 504.

The weight of meteorites varies very considerably, ranging from tons to very small specimens. It not only depends on their volume but on their chemical composition, as some --- the stony ones --- have a low density, while the "irons" are of nearly pure metal.

The largest meteorites of which mention is made are those of Otumpa (province of Tucuman, South America), an iron weighing 30 tons; of Durango (Mexico), 19 tons; and of Cranbourne (Australia), now in the British Museum, which weighs over 3 tons.

The Nejed iron, the largest which has been seen to fall, weighs nearly 130 lb. Considering the very considerable number of falls which have taken place, the number of irons which have been _seen to fall_ is remarkably small. They are as follows ---

Agram, 1751.  
Tennessee, 1835.  
Braunau, 1847.  
Victoria West (South Africa), 1862.  
Nejed, 1863.  
Nidigullam (Madras), 1870.  
Rowton, Shropshire, 1876.  
Mazapil, 1885.  
Cabin Creek, 1886.

The following table contains a list of some of the larger meteorites, besides those mentioned above, which have been found from time to time, with the locality of their fall and their weights in grammes (1000 grammes = 2.2 lb. avoirdupois (nearly), and 1,018,181 grammes (nearly) = 1 ton):---

_Classification of Meteorites._

Meteorites have been arranged in three classes: first, masses of iron alloyed with nickel, which have been called by Maskelyne aëro-siderites (_aer_, air, and _sideros_, iron), or briefly siderites; secondly, those which are almost wholly composed of stone, and called aërolites (_aer_, air, and _lithos_, stone); and thirdly, those which are composed of stone and iron in more or less equal quantities, consisting of a spongy mass of iron interlaced with stony matter like that of the aërolites, and called siderolites or meso-siderites.

M. Daubrée's general classification of meteorites is as follows ---

Meteorites  
->Containing metallic iron  
-->Not containing stony matter  
--->Holosidères  
-->Containing iron with stony matter  
--->The iron constituting a matrix which encases stony grains  
---->Syssidères  
--->The iron existing in the form of grains among stony matter  
---->Sporadosidères  
->Not containing metallic iron  
-->Asidères

This brings us to consider the chemistry of these messengers from the celestial spaces.

# Chapter 3. The Chemistry of Meteorites.

We have seen that the main difference between the specimens of these bodies which have been collected is that some of them are mainly iron, some of them are mainly stone; and that there is a passage between these two conditions represented by falls in which we have a paste of iron including stony fragments.

We have now to enter into some points connected with their chemical constitution somewhat more in detail.

Of the chemical elements which are at present recognised as such, about one-fourth are found by chemical analysis to exist in meteorites. These, according to the tables given by Maskelyne,* Fletcher,* Smith, and others are as follows.

*) _Nature_, vol. 12. p. 505.

*) _Introduction to Study of Meteorites_, p. 30.

Those that occur most constantly are ---

Hydrogen  
Calcium  
Iron  
Aluminium  
Nickel  
Carbon  
Magnesium  
Oxygen  
Manganese  
Sulphur  
Cobalt  
Silicon  
Copper*  
Phosphorus  

*) With regard to the presence of cobalt and copper, Dr. L. Smith says (_Mineralogy and Chemistry_, p. 352): "In every analysis that I have made of meteoric irons (over one hundred different specimens) cobalt has been invariably found, along with a minute quantity of copper." --- Flight, _History of Meteorites_, p. 164.

while the following occur less frequently or in smaller quantities:---

Lithium  
Chromium Sodium  
Tin Potassium  
Arsenic Strontium  
Antimony Titanium  
Chlorine Nitrogen  

Of these elementary bodies only hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon occur in an elementary condition. Hydrogen and nitrogen are asserted to be occluded as gases in the stones. Carbon exists both in the form of graphite and diamond.

From the above lists it will be seen that among the elements most common in meteorites are recognised many which have a very wide distribution and exist in great quantities in the surface and envelopes of our planet. But this is true only of the elements.

Many mineral compounds terrestrially common are absent; perhaps the most striking case of all is the absolute absence of free quartz whether crystallised or not from meteorites, while terrestrially it is the most prevalent compound known, and enters into the composition of such common rocks as trachyte, felsite, syenite, gneiss, and granite.

Again, many of the chemical combinations met with are unknown to terrestrial mineralogy. The chemical compounds found in meteorites which are new to our mineralogy may be briefly referred to. Some are combinations with sulphur, as follows ---

Sulphur + Iron = Troilite;  
Sulphur + Calcium = Oldhamite;  
Sulphur + (Calcium, Titanium) = Osbornite;  
Sulphur + (Iron, Chromium) = Daubréelite.  

Phosphides of iron and nickel, forming varieties of so-called schreibersite, are met with.

It has already been stated that carbon in some form or other exists in most meteorites. Some of them are partly composed of this element compounded with hydrogen and oxygen. In this case it exists as a white or a yellowish crystallisable matter, soluble in ether and partly so in alcohol, and exhibiting the characters and the composition of one or more hydrocarbonaceous bodies with high melting-points.

The meteorites of Alais and Cold Bokkeweld are instances of this group. The former is of a black colour both internally and externally, is combustible, and contains sulphates of magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium, which are all soluble in water. The latter, after being experimented upon, left a residue which gave out a very bituminous smell; this substance was yellow, and it was found that it was only another form of carbon in a state of intimate mixture, amounting to about 1.67 per cent.

Some carbonaceous stones are dark gray in colour, have little lustre, and are soft; they contain no visible meteoric iron, but an abundance of light gray rounded bodies, among which are occasionally some with a dull metallic lustre and of a greenish-yellow colour, and others of a dark gray compact substance and of earthy character.*

*) Flight, _op. cit._ p. 211.

Various alloys of nickel and iron also occur; those which play the most important part have, according to Meunier, the following composition:---

|Density.|Formula.  
Tænite|7.380|Fe6Ni  
Plessite|7.850|Fe10Ni  
Kamacite|7.652|Fe14Ni  
Braunine|(?)|Fe16Ni  

Among other minerals we may name ---

Lawrencite, protochloride of iron;  
Maskelynite, with the composition of labradorite;  
Silica (as asmanite).

We now come to the common ground.

The following compounds are identical in composition and crystallographic character with minerals found on our globe:---

Magnetic pyrites|Fe7S8  
Magnetite|Fe3O4  
Chromite|(Fe,Cr)3O4  
Silicates, _viz._ ---  
Olivine varieties.  
Enstatite and bronzite.  
Diopside and augite.  
Anorthite and labradorite.  
Breunnerite.

Among gaseous compounds, the oxides of carbon have been detected in many meteorites, and it is asserted that these gases have been occluded by them in the same manner as the elementary gases hydrogen and nitrogen.

In the "irons" we deal chiefly with nickel-iron, magnesium, manganese, and copper, as metals.

In the "stones" we deal with combinations of magnesium, iron, oxygen, and silicon. One of the most usual substances is called olivine, and sometimes the olivine is in a slightly changed form, in which the quantity of iron is increased, and we get bronzite. Nickel-iron, manganese, and other substances are also found in the stones.

Chemical analysis of the irons has established in them, taken as a whole, the existence of the following mineral species:---

1\. The general metallic mass, which consists of certain alloys, in which iron and nickel predominate to such an extent that the term nickel-iron is by common consent applied to it.

The nickel-iron is an alloy or compound special to meteorites, and the irons are chiefly composed of it. The tracery to which I have referred, observed on the metallic surface treated with acids, was discovered by Widmanstätten. The figures are caused by the crystallisation of the mass: with the iron and nickel magnesium is always associated, _so that we get magnesium in all meteoritic irons_ as well as in the stones.

2\. Compounds of iron and carbon, principally campbelline and chalypite (Fe2C).

3\. Troilite (FeNi)7S8, generally appearing as kidney-shaped masses.

4\. Schreibersite (Fe4Ni2P).

5\. Graphite.

6\. Stony grains, generally magnesium and iron silicates.

7\. Occluded gases.

8\. The crust or varnish. This has been found to be due entirely to the oxidation of the metal. The formula of the crust of the Toluca meteorite, according to Meunier, is Fe2O3(FeNi)O.

The quantities of occluded gases vary considerably. Hydrogen is the first to come out when a vacuum is produced, and in the cold --- that is, when the tube containing the meteorite is not heated.

Thus, Graham found in the Lenarto meteorite, and in a comparative experiment with clean horse-shoe nails made of iron* ---

*) Graham, _Chemical and Physical Researches_, p. 283.

|Meteorite.|Nails.  Hydrogen|85.68|35.0  Carbonic oxide|4.46|50.3  Carbonic acid|...|7.7  Nitrogen|9.86|7.0  |100.00|100.00

Mallet subsequently found in the meteorite picked up in Augusta County* ---

*) _Chemical News_, 21st June 1872.

Hydrogen|85.68  
Carbonic oxide|4.46  
Nitrogen|9.86

Dr. A. Wright subsequently determined the composition of the gases given off at different temperatures, using the Iowa meteorite. The results were as follows ---

|Hydrogen.|Carbonic Oxide.|Carbonic Acid.|Nitrogen.  
Cold|49|14|35|...  
At 100° C.|4.54|0 (?)|95.46|...  
At 200° C.|5.86|1.82|92.32|...  
Red heat.|87.53|0|5.56|6

As regards the so-called occluded gases, iron and stony meteorites, according to Wright, show a marked distinction. While the gases of the Lenarto iron contained 85.68 per cent of hydrogen, those obtained from cosmical masses of the stony kind, such as the Iowa meteorite, are characterised by the presence of carbonic acid, which constitutes nine-tenths of the gas evolved at the temperature of boiling water, and about one-half of that given off at a low red heat.

This view of Wright's has been called in question by Mallet, who refers to his examination of the gases of the iron of Augusta County, Virginia, where the ratio of the oxides of carbon to hydrogen is 4.3, and to his having pointed out in 1872 that hydrogen could no longer be regarded as the characteristic gaseous ingredient of meteoric iron.*

*) Flight, _op. cit._ p. 80.

In the siderites the iron varies from 80 to 98 per cent, and the nickel from 6 to 10 per cent. Sometimes the nickel is found in larger quantities, as in the iron of d'Octibbeha County, Mississippi, found in the year 1854, which contained as much as 59 per cent, while the iron was only 37 per cent.

There is a singular circumstance connected with the varnish of stony meteorites which was observed by Reinsch in the meteorite of Krähenberg. The grains of metallic iron and troilite contained in the varnish show no signs of oxidation. In the meteorite of Morbihan, also, grains of nickel-iron project not only through the smooth inner but also the rough outer crust. It has been suggested that the surface of these meteorites was vitrified before it entered our air, or at all events those lower strata of it in which oxygen is abundant.*

*) _Ib._, _Geological Magazine_, January 1875.

In many cases minute chemical analysis has been most useful in showing that meteorites which have been found in different localities really belong to the same fall.

Professor Nordenskjöld, on examining the Ställdalen meteorites (Sweden, 28th June 1876), found that they resembled some eight or nine others which he had before examined, although they were entirely unconnected as regards their date of appearance; and that together they would form a well-marked group, which, he observes, will probably be found to be only one among many similar groups of aërolites which will hereafter be detected.

Dr. Laurence Smith, from the presence of Daubréelite, inferred a common origin for two meteorites which fell four years apart.*

*) Professor A. S. Herschel, _Monthly Notices_, R. A. S., 1878, p. 219.

The following short table brings together in a compact form the chief substances met with in meteorites. It will indicate the cause of the continued reference to the spectra of magnesium, iron, manganese, and carbon in what follows ---

_Siderites._  
Nickel-iron, manganese, copper.

Schreibersite = iron and nickel phosphide, with which magnesium is always associated.  
Daubréelite = iron and chromium sulphide.  

_Siderolites._  
_Chondritic_ ---  
α\. Non-Carbonaceous ---  
Olivine = chrysolite = peridot = (MgFe)2O4Si = SiO2 41.3, MgO 50.9, FeO 7.7.  
Enstatite MgO3Si = SiO2 60, MgO 40.  
Bronzite = enstatite, in which some magnesium is replaced by iron.  
Nickel-iron, manganese.  
Troilite.  
Chromite = iron protoxide 32, chromium sesquioxide 68, + aluminium and magnesium.  
Augite = pyroxene, SiO2, 55, CaO 23, MgO 16, MnO 0.5, FeO 4.

Bronzite.  
Augite.  
Anorthite.  

# Part 2. The Spectroscopy of Meteorites.

## Chapter 4. Experiments on the Spectra of Metals found in Meteorites.

Many particulars have already been garnered relating to the spectra of those substances met with in meteorites. The next thing is to summarise them. In doing this, we shall not only be bringing together a stock of facts on which we can draw, but various laboratory processes useful in the present inquiry will necessarily be indicated. It need scarcely be said that the experimental work recorded in this and the subsequent chapters forms the basis of all the conclusions, both general and special, which will be given in due course.

A complete history is out of the question here, and to a large extent I limit myself to the work carried on in the Normal School laboratories during the last two years.

When I commenced my researches on meteorites, it soon became evident that the most needful direction in which to work was to observe the phenomena visible at low temperatures. It was obviously important that we should study the spectra of meteorites at various temperatures, high as well as low; but in any case, in order that we might completely unriddle them, it was necessary that we should begin by studying the spectra of those substances which have been found in them, or which they might be suspected to contain.

Obviously, the best way to begin this survey was to start with the lowest temperatures and gradually work up to the highest. We might conveniently begin by observing the spectra at the temperature of the Bunsen burner, then at that of the oxy-coal-gas flame, passing subsequently to those of a comparatively cool electric spark, of the electric arc, and finally of the jar spark.

Much of the high temperature work had been already done. To be completely equipped for the inquiry, then, it was necessary to secure and bring together facts relating to low temperatures. After the phenomena observed by means of the flame of a Bunsen burner had been recorded, the oxy-coal-gas flame was used. In the method of work adopted an ordinary oxyhydrogen blow-pipe jet was employed, coal-gas, as a rule, being substituted for hydrogen. When oxygen is blown through a gas-flame in this way, a long-pointed flame is obtained which is hot enough to fuse platinum, but still is much cooler than the electric spark. The flame is directed very slightly upwards and towards the slit, in the same line as the collimator, and at a distance of 2 or 3 feet from it. A lens of convenient focal length, in this case about 8 or 9 inches, is then placed between the flame and the slit, in such a position that an image of the flame falls exactly on the middle of the slit.

A small portion of the substance to be examined is then supported in a pair of forceps (or on a clean slip of glass) arranged in such a way that it can be raised or lowered by turning a thumb-screw. The substance is then inserted in the flame. Fuller details will be given in Chapter 6 when we come to deal with the analysis of meteorites.

The following table shows the positions of the principal lines, bands, and flutings seen in the spectrum of each of the metals examined, at the two temperatures indicated, arranged roughly in the order of their intensities.

It should here be stated that as some of the researches have had to deal with feeble illumination small dispersion has been of necessity employed; and to make the observations along the several lines comparable, a one-prism spectroscope was in the first instance used throughout. Hence the wave-lengths given are in all cases only approximate. With this proviso the lines observed have been as follows ---

[TABLE]

[Fig. 3. --- Spectra of Metals at the Temperature of the Oxy-Coal-Gas Blowpipe.]()

All the flutings, with the exception of those seen in the case of magnesium, have their maxima towards the blue, and shade off towards the red end of the spectrum.

The map reproduced in Fig. 3 shows the spectra of the various metals at the temperature of the oxy-coal-gas flame; the thick lines represent bands, and the shaded bands represent flutings.

In comparing the spectrum of a substance which has been mapped in the laboratory with the spectrum of a meteorite, we should naturally look for the brightest lines, bands, or flutings first, and hence it is convenient to map the spectra in such a way that we can at once say which characteristic of the spectrum will be the first to appear. We have mainly to consider those bands or flutings which stand out prominently in the spectrum, and are the first to flash out when only a small quantity of substance is volatilised. Thus, in the flame spectrum of barium there is an almost continuous background of flutings with a few brighter bands in the green; here it is most important for us to consider the _bands_, as the flutings mainly add to the general continuous spectrum in the case of radiation, or produce a general dimming of the continuous spectrum in the case of absorption.

Fig. 4 is a map of a few of the more important elements which enter into our discussions, constructed upon this principle. Five orders of intensities are represented, the longest lines, bands, or flutings being the brightest. The lines, bands or flutings, shown on the lowest horizon in the case of each element are those seen at the lowest temperatures, and are the first to make their appearance; everything shown on the lowest horizon is visible at the temperature of the Bunsen burner, but only the brightest phenomena visible at that temperature are represented. Those on the upper horizons are the faintest, and are only seen when the temperature is slightly increased, or a considerable quantity of substance is volatilised.

A glance at the map shows that if there are any indications of magnesium, for instance, in bodies at low temperatures, the fluting at wave-length 500 will be seen, possibly without the other fluting or lines. The first indication of manganese will be the fluting at 558, and so on.

[Fig. 4. --- Spectra of Metals showing the Changes brought about by Change of Temperature.]()

_Experiments upon the Luminous Phenomena of the various Metals volatilised in the Bunsen Burner and the Oxy-coal-gas Blowpipe Flame as compared with the Phenomena seen at higher Temperatures._

In connection with the above work there are some points of interest which may be referred to in this place.

It is important to know whether at low temperatures the phenomena presented by these metals are equally intense, or whether is there a great difference. As a matter of fact there is a great difference, and we can determine the order of visibility, beginning at the substance most easily visible at the lowest temperature.

The main conclusions are that certain lines, bands, and flutings are seen in the Bunsen burner, that a larger number is seen in the flame, but that the total number seen in the burner and flame is relatively small as compared with the lines seen in the spectra at higher temperatures.

The order of visibility in the Bunsen is, roughly ---

_Lines_  
Sodium  
Lithium  
Thallium  
Strontium  
Barium  
Calcium  
Potassium  
Manganese  
Bismuth  

_Bands_  
Calcium  
Strontium  
Barium  

_Flutings_  
Magnesium  
Manganese  

All the observations both of Bunsen and oxyhydrogen flame may be condensed as follows ---

_In metals of the alkalies_  
Sodium  
Potassium  
Lithium  

_In metals of the alkaline earths_  
Calcium  
Strontium  
Barium  

_In magnesian metals_  
Magnesium  
Zinc  
Cadmium  

_In iron metals_  
Iron  
Nickel  
Cobalt  
Manganese  
Chromium  

_In metals which yield acids_  
Bismuth  
Titanium  
Tungsten  

_In copper metals_  
Copper  
Thallium  

_In noble metals_  
Silver  
Mercury  

_In earthy metals_  
Cerium   

_Special Experiments upon Magnesium._

It is also important to study the effect of temperature upon the spectrum. Some experiments upon magnesium may be referred to as giving an idea of the kind of change observed, for this spectrum perhaps brings before us in the most striking manner the beautiful effects produced by the passage from a lower to a higher temperature.

It is generally held that the

Bunsen burner  
Oxy-coal-gas flame  
Electric arc  Spark with jar  

bring before us the effects of different temperatures, increasing in the order in which they have been named; thus we read of spectra seen at the temperature of the Bunsen, arc, _etc._ These terms are fully recognised, and everybody knows what they mean, although the temperature of the Bunsen, and perhaps even the temperature of the arc, does not always remain constant when different substances are introduced into it.

In a paper which I communicated to the Royal Society in 1879* I described the results of some experiments on this spectrum. There are three well-known lines in the green, at wave-lengths 5183, 5172, 5166.7, which are designated _b1_, _b2_, and _b4_, and are characteristic of magnesium. Now in the flame the two least refrangible of these, _b1_ and _b2_, are alone seen, and they are associated with a third line, the remnant of a fluting at 5210, so as to form a triplet. There are also visible a line in the blue and the fluting at 500. On passing to the temperature of the spark, 5210 practically disappears and is replaced by _b4_, the wide triplet thus giving way to a narrower one, _b1_ and _b2_ being common to both, as shown in Fig. 5. At the same time the line in the blue disappears and gives place to two new ones.

*) _Roy. Soc. Proc._ vol. 30. p. 27.

[Fig. 5. --- Changes in the Spectrum of Magnesium. 1. Arc Spectrum. 2. Flame Spectrum.]()

In the Bunsen, as ordinarily employed, the fluting at 500 far eclipses the other parts of the spectrum in brilliancy, and at this temperature I have also photographed a close triplet in the ultraviolet at wave-length 373.

If, however, magnesium be burnt in the hollow of a large Bunsen flame, the fluting at 5210 is seen without the one at 500. This band has been ascribed by Professors Liveing and Dewar to magnesium and hydrogen, not necessarily as a compound, and the one at 500 to oxide of magnesium; but this is by no means proved as yet. It is, however, a point of only secondary importance in the considerations which follow, whether these flutings really proceed from the metals themselves or from compounds of them.

At the highest temperature _b_ is more brilliant than the other lines, and the fluting of 500 has entirely disappeared.

As in magnesium, so also in manganese and lead the change from flutings to lines with increase of temperature is beautifully seen.

At intervals during the last fifteen years I have been engaged in researches on the spectrum of carbon, and there are so many difficulties that even now the research is not completed. The general work has consisted of observations of flames of combustible carbon compounds; the electric arc between carbon poles, and gaseous carbon compounds enclosed in Geissler tubes and rendered incandescent by a current from an induction coil.

A candle consists of certain compounds of carbon, and when burning, these substances are rendered luminous, so that they become capable of giving spectra. If the slit of a spectroscope be directed towards the base of a candle flame, two or three bright flutings of the carbon spectrum will be seen. The upper and more luminous part of the flame gives a perfectly continuous spectrum, because we have there to deal with the incandescence of solid particles.

When a strong electric current is passed between carbon poles, the gases in the space between the poles are rendered incandescent. Some carbon is volatilised, and consequently the spectrum of carbon is observed in that of the electric arc. The spectrum seen, however, depends upon what part of the arc is examined, as some parts are cooler than others. At the negative pole certain flutings are seen, whilst other flutings are special to the positive pole, and others still are characteristic of the long flame which often accompanies the arc. The conditions of the arc also are such that carbon can to a small extent combine with the nitrogen of the air, and the result is that the spectrum of the compound molecules of nitrocarbon is in all probability visible in a certain portion of the arc.

The spectrum of a gas rendered incandescent by an electric current may be obtained in several ways. We may either use a short spark and pass it through the gas at ordinary pressure, or we may enclose the gas in a glass tube fitted with platinum points, connected at one end to a Sprengel pump so that a vacuum can be produced, and at the other end with an apparatus for generating the gas. At reduced pressures, when there is but little of the gas to be rendered incandescent, very long sparks can be made to pass; in my own investigations I have employed tubes of various lengths, the distance between the platinum points varying from about 1/16 of an inch to 6 feet. In all these experiments it is desirable to use what are called end-on tubes, so that the light throughout the length of the tube may be made to fall on the slit of the spectroscope. A form of tube which I have found to be very convenient is shown in Fig. 6. This permits of discharges of various kinds being passed through the same gas without the necessity of changing the tube each time, a change in the pressure, at the most, being all that is required for a change of spark. It will be noted that the tube is partly a capillary tube and partly one with a wide bore; this is very important, as with the same length of spark the temperature is greater in the capillary tube. Simpler forms of end-on tubes have also been employed. In working with a tube of this description, it is best to place it at a distance of about 2 feet from the slit, in the same line as the collimator of the spectroscope, and to focus the light on the slit by interposing a lens of suitable focal length.

[Fig. 6. --- End-on Tube.]()

In these experiments all the joints between the tubes are made air-tight by surrounding the short indiarubber tubes joining them with mercury or glycerine.

The generator, of course, varies according to the nature of the gas to be experimented with. In the case of carbonic acid, for instance, it is convenient to prepare the gas by heating some bicarbonate of soda in a closed combustion tube. The gas is then passed through another part of the tube containing phosphoric anhydride, in order to dry it. This is connected with the spectrum tube, which is again connected with the air pump. The first thing to be done is to get as perfect a vacuum as possible, and then to fill the tube with the gas, and again pump out. This operation having been repeated three or four times, the gas will then be practically pure. Variations of pressure are then obtained by the use of the pump, or by further heating of the combustion tube.

In the case of a liquid like benzole or alcohol, after chemical purification, it is enclosed in a strong bulb, which, by means of a stop-cock tube, is connected with the spectrum tube. The washing-through process in this case necessitates the use of the stop-cock, which is made safe by surrounding it with mercury, as otherwise a vacuum could not be obtained until all the liquid had evaporated.

Other forms of generators have to be used in special cases.

The great difficulty connected with this kind of work is to get rid of traces of impurities of air and moisture. By washing the gas through a great many times, and keeping the apparatus hot, it is possible to obtain the gas practically free from even spectroscopic impurities. In the case of a hydrocarbon like benzole, it is first freed from occluded air and moisture by boiling it in a reflux condenser with chips of sodium. This arrangement allows the liquid to boil away, then recondense and fall back to be again boiled. Sodium has a great affinity for oxygen, and if any water were present, it would at once combine with the oxygen, and liberate hydrogen. In this way the liquid would be freed from oxygen.

The spectra of many compounds of carbon with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, and sulphur have been observed in this way, and it is found that under certain conditions, which vary with the compound experimented upon, there are some flutings common to all. Now these obviously must be due to carbon, since carbon is the only common constituent. The importance of getting rid of all traces of air and moisture will now be clear, as these would form _compounds_ common to all.

This research is beset with difficulties; observers have contradicted each other, have made certain statements, have recanted, and have recanted again. The consensus is certainly now greater than it was formerly, but there are still divergences. The main conclusions which may be stated here are, that there are two systems of flutings which depend upon temperature only. At low temperatures all compounds of carbon give a set of simple flutings, the brightest of which are at wave-lengths 4510, 4830, 5195, and 5610. At higher temperatures there is a series of compound flutings, the brightest edges of which are at wave-lengths 438, 4738, 5165, and 5640. At very high temperatures each compound gives us the _line_ spectra of its constituents. Thus, marsh gas would give us the lines of carbon and hydrogen, and carbonic oxide the lines of carbon and oxygen. The passage from one spectrum to another is not abrupt, but takes place gradually as the temperature is gradually altered.

It is necessary to point out that the temperature at which one particular spectrum is visible is not the same for all compounds of carbon. Thus, since benzole, a compound of carbon and hydrogen, is more easily decomposed than say carbonic oxide, the high temperature fluted spectrum of carbon might be obtained from benzole at the temperature that would only give the cool carbon flutings in the case of carbonic oxide.

Besides these flutings there is another at wave-length 431, which is special to the compounds of carbon containing hydrogen. This fluting is therefore characteristic of hydrocarbon. Another group, consisting of seven flutings, beginning at 460 and extending to 450, is seen when compounds of carbon and nitrogen are broken up.

But even now we have not considered all the flutings of carbon. There are others about which there is room for difference of opinion. These, some ascribe to cyanogen, while I still attribute them to slightly different groupings of the carbon molecules, and these it has been found convenient to call carbon B, to distinguish them from the flutings previously mentioned, which have been called carbon A. These and their relation to temperature are shown in Fig. 7. The principal line of carbon is in the blue part of the spectrum at wave-length 4266. The diagram shows the passage from the line stage to the other stages, first to the ultra-violet group, and then to the less refrangible group. It will be seen that at one temperature both lines and flutings are present. While the blue line gradually thins out, the ultra-violet flutings appear first and grow in intensity. As these increase, the blue flutings become visible, and further, as the latter augment and the line disappears, the ultra-violet flutings die out altogether.

[Fig. 7. --- Part of the Spectrum of Carbon B.]()

There is one other point which is of great importance. This is the variation in the appearance of the blue band beginning at 474. Under some conditions the maximum luminosity of this band is not at 474, but at 468, whilst under other conditions the band is almost uniform from 474 to 461. This is shown in Fig. 8, which is engraved from a photograph of the spectrum of alcohol vapour at three temperatures, the top one being at the highest and the bottom one the lowest temperature.

When we come to study the spectra of those celestial bodies in which carbon appears, we shall see the importance of this; if we had not this evidence, we should not be in a position to assign the same origin to two apparently different bands.

[Fig. 8. --- Change in the Appearances presented by the Band at 474.]()

In what has been said the red end of the spectra has been left out of consideration; it is sufficient to state here that in this region are chiefly found those appearances _special_ to each compound.

_Experiments upon Hydrogen._

I pointed out many years ago that, when under certain conditions the spectrum of hydrogen is examined at the lowest possible temperature, the F (green) line retains its brilliancy long after the C (red) line disappears; and the fact that, after these lines have been made to disappear from the spectral tube, the spectrum which remains visible, and is sometimes very brightly visible, is also due to hydrogen, has always been a matter of thorough belief in my mind, although so many observers, down even to M. Cornu not so very long ago, have been inclined to attribute it to the existence of "impurities."

I began to map the so-called structural spectrum at the College of Chemistry in 1869, but other matters supervened which prevented the accomplishment of this work. This, however, is a matter of small importance, because quite recently Dr. Hasselberg has communicated to the St. Petersburg Academy an admirable memoir on the subject, accompanied by a map (_Mémoires de l'Académie Impériale_, Series 7., vol. 30., No. 7, Hasselberg). The brightest portions of the structure spectrum are shown in Fig. 11.

The most convenient way of obtaining a supply of hydrogen for investigations of this kind is to use a little sodium which has never been in contact with hydrocarbon, or a piece of magnesium wire; to place them in the lower end of a glass tube, one part of which can be used as an end-on tube, and then, after getting a vacuum so perfect that the spark will not pass, to slightly heat the metal. After a time the spectrum of hydrogen, sometimes accompanied by the low temperature flutings of carbon, begins to be visible alike from the sodium and the magnesium.

If the vacuum has been very perfect to start with, at first the bright lines C and F will be visible without any trace of structure, and the hydrogen will be of a magnificent red colour. If now the action of the pump be stopped, and the sodium be still more heated, the colour will change from red to violet, and finally a point will be reached at which the conductibility of the gas is at its maximum, and then, the jar not being in circuit, the structure spectrum of the gas will be seen absolutely alone, without any trace of either C or F. The gradual disappearance of the F line is very striking, and when the bright line is out of the field the lines due to the structure seem to be enhanced in brilliancy.

The brightest part of the spectrum is then that near D; in the blue-green we have a line at 464 more refrangible than F, and then a double line at 4930 and 4935; other less refrangible lines are seen. These are phenomena seen associated with sodium, but if we use the hydrogen produced from a piece of magnesium wire or from a crystal of olivine, under the same circumstances we find that, so far as the lines of hydrogen go, the phenomenon remains the same, but that there is then visible in the spectrum a line at 500, which is in reality the remnant of the fluting at that wave-length which has been recorded in the spectrum of magnesium under other conditions.

## Chapter 6. Spectroscopic Analysis of Meteorites.

_Meteoritic Glows_

A great many investigations of the low temperature spectra of meteorites have been already made, and one method of investigation has been the following:---

A small fragment of any particular meteorite, or still better some dust, is inserted in an end-on tube, such as I have already described; this is placed in front of a spectroscope, so that a spectroscopic record of the luminosity may be obtained. The tube is at the same time connected with a Sprengel pump, in order to obtain a vacuum; it is supplied with poles, and thus an electric current may be sent through it. Supposing that such bodies as meteorites exist in free space, we must understand that they are situated practically in a vacuum, so that it is perfectly fair to begin the laboratory work by getting a vacuum as nearly as possible. The next thing to do is to try the effect of the lowest temperature, and for that purpose the central part of the tube containing the little fragments is heated by a Bunsen burner.

If any effect is produced by this application of heat it will, after some little time, be evidenced by the formation of a spectrum or by some change in the pre-existing one. What has been found is that there is scarcely any meteorite which can be examined in this way which does not give off a sufficient quantity of hydrogen to allow the hydrogen spectrum, when a feeble electric current is made to travel along the tube, to be very beautifully visible.

If the temperature of the meteoritic particles be kept sufficiently low, we see practically the spectrum of hydrogen alone. This is a demonstration of the very well-known fact that, with those bodies generally acknowledged to enter into the composition of meteorites, hydrogen is always associated.

If under similar conditions the temperature is increased, the spectrum of carbon begins to be visible, indicating that, associated with the hydrogen, there is some compound (or compounds) of carbon in the meteorite which requires a higher temperature to bring it out, but which is displayed when that higher temperature is employed. The carbonaceous structure of some meteorites has already been determined on other grounds.

If we carry the heating a little further still, and, instead of leaving the particles relatively cold and dark while the current is passing, we apply a higher temperature outside the tube by means of the Bunsen burner, then we get the luminous vapours of some constituents of the meteorite added to the spectra of hydrogen and carbon.

What luminous vapours do we get first, and which last? The experiment is a very interesting one, and may certainly be carried on in a tube such as that described until a pretty considerable development of the spectrum is obtained. When particles of a meteorite are treated in this way the first substance which, after the hydrogen and carbon, makes itself obviously visible is magnesium derived from the olivine, that substance which exists in the greatest quantity in the stones, and in the schreibersite which exists in the irons.

The representative of magnesium in this case is generally the fluting, or the remnant of the fluting, at wave-length 500 (see Fig. 4), which is seen so brilliantly when magnesium ribbon is burned in the Bunsen. Usually only the brightest part of the fluting is seen, and it then appears as a line.

The line at 500 is constantly, and another line at 495 is occasionally, seen. This line is less refrangible than the structure line of hydrogen in this region, which occupies nearly the same position as a barium line, at 493; if the heating be continued, especially in the case of stony meteorites, it is soon succeeded by a much more brilliant green glow, in which magnesium _b_ and many other lines appear, accompanied by the carbon flutings.

_Spectra of Meteorites in the Oxy-Coal-Gas Flame._

From such a method of research as the above we can pass to one in which, by means of the oxy-coal-gas flame, the spectrum of any vapour given off, provided any vapour _is_ given off at a still higher temperature, can be observed. Many meteorites have been examined in this way, and the main result is that, in the case of an "iron," the first substance to make its appearance is manganese, and the next substance to become obvious is iron.

[Fig. 9a. --- Arrangement of Apparatus for observing the Oxy-Coal-Gas Flame Spectra of Meteorites.]()

Here a very important remark must be made. The substance which will give us the predominant spectrum at lowest temperature must be that substance the volatility of which, at that temperature, is greatest. If, however complicated the chemical constitution of one of these meteorites may be, there is one substance which volatilises out of it more readily than another at a low temperature, that substance will be the first to give us its characteristic spectrum at that temperature --- and in fact we may get the spectrum of that substance alone, although its percentage in the meteorite may be extremely small. It is therefore an important result to find that, in meteorites in which the quantity of iron is very considerable, it is always the manganese that makes itself visible first, because its volatility is greater than that of iron. The point to bear in mind is that when we pass to the temperature of the oxy-coal-gas flame we get predominant evidence of the existence of manganese, and afterwards of iron.

The observations gave in all only about ten or a dozen lines belonging to the metals magnesium, iron, sodium, lithium and potassium, and two flutings, one of manganese and one of iron.

Many diagrams of such observations of the oxy-coal-gas flame-spectrum of meteorites and of olivine have been constructed, and not only the spectra of the flame but also of the "glow," --- glow being the name given to the luminosity produced in the tube under the conditions stated. There are some points of similarity, and other points of difference. One of the results which is most constant is the appearance of the line at 500; this seems to run through all the observations until we come to deal with such meteorites as the Limerick and Nejed. On the other hand, some lines and flutings do not make their appearance generally.

_Spectra of Meteorites in the Electric Arc._

If we wish to extend our inquiry into the action of a still higher temperature we can use the electric arc; that also has been done. For this purpose specimens of iron meteorites have been cut into poles, the spectra of which have been observed and photographed, so that the vapours produced have been the vapours of the pure iron meteorites; had a small portion of a meteorite been placed on an impure carbon pole, the impurities of the carbon would have been observed and photographed with the pure vapours of the meteorites. In addition to this method --- in the case of the stony meteorites --- the lower pole, after its spectrum has been well studied, has been utilised in this way; the upper pole remaining constant as an iron pole, pretty large particles of various stony meteorites have been inserted into the lower pole, and the added result carefully recorded. Further, composite photographs of the spectra of many meteorites have been obtained. Half a dozen different stony meteorites were successively rendered incandescent by their insertion into the lower pole during the exposure of a single photographic plate.

It is obvious that if we can get detailed information on such points as these, and provided there are meteorites in space of the temperatures at which we are able to determine their spectra in the laboratory, such data should be of extreme value, for at present we know of no reason why the spectra should differ according to locality.

The method of work with an electric arc is to place the lamp with its poles in the line of the collimator of the spectroscope at a distance of 2 or 3 feet from the slit, an image of the poles being formed on the slit by a lens. It is convenient to place the collimator in a north and south line, so that a siderostat can be employed to send a beam of sunlight through the slit at any hour of the day. The siderostat is an arrangement by means of which a mirror is driven by clockwork in such a way that it reflects light from the sun in a constant direction, notwithstanding the apparent motion of that body. The beam being reflected through the collimator, another lens is placed in its path so as to form an image of the sun between the poles of the lamp. The light from the sun and that from the arc thus enter the spectroscope under exactly the same conditions, and both spectra will be brought to the same focus.

At this temperature there are so many lines visible that it is most satisfactory to register them by photography. An ordinary photographic plate is only sensitive to blue light, but recent investigations have resulted in making it quite easy to photograph the green and yellow parts of the spectrum, and even the red with a little more trouble. I am indebted to Professor O. T. Sherman, of Yale College, for a formula which has suited this purpose admirably. By the use of these plates, photographs extending from a little below K to D have been obtained, the complete length of the spectrum, which was taken in three stages, being about 15 inches.

A photograph of the spectrum of the Obernkirchen meteorite, taken in this way, shows no less than 378 lines, of which 348 are due to iron. This latter fact is ascertained from a comparison of the spectrum of the meteorite with that of very pure iron, which was kindly supplied to me by Professor Roberts-Austen, of the Royal Mint, taken under exactly the same conditions. Besides the iron lines, the photograph also shows 16 lines of nickel, 3 of chromium, 1 of cobalt, 4 of manganese, 2 of titanium, and four unknown lines. It is also worth noting that this particular meteorite shows practically no sodium, although the nickel line, between the two D lines, is pretty bright.

[Fig. 10. --- Arrangement of Apparatus for observing the Spark Spectra of Meteorites.]()

_Spectra of Meteorites in Quantity Spark without Jar._

A still higher temperature may be obtained by using an electric spark. But in order that we may pass, by small stages, from low to high temperatures, we must begin the spark experiments by using a coil without a Leyden jar in the circuit. Fig. 10 shows how the apparatus is arranged for an experiment of this kind. Two of the thick wires connected with the coil proceed from the battery shown in the cupboard behind, and the other two lead to a condenser beneath the table. A finer wire leads from one terminal of the coil to the discharging apparatus, while the other terminal is connected in such a manner that an air-break can be introduced. In the diagram a Leyden jar in circuit is shown; it can be thrown out of the circuit by simply lifting it from the insulated metal disc on which it rests. The outer coating of the jar is connected with one terminal of the coil, and the inner coating with the other terminal.

The sparking arrangement itself consists of two insulated pairs of forceps arranged so that the distance between them can be changed at will, and the whole system may either be raised or lowered. Two fragments of the meteorite to be examined are then placed in the forceps and the spark passed. In order that the space between the fragments may be filled with vapour, the distance between them is usually made about 1/16 or 1/8 of an inch. With a longer spark, it generally happens that the air spectrum is more prominent than the spectrum of the meteorite, especially when the jar is in circuit.

An image of the spark is formed on the slit of the spectroscope in the usual way by means of a lens mounted on an adjustable stand. The spectroscope shown in the diagram is of the form known as the direct-vision spectroscope. Unlike an ordinary spectroscope, this shows a spectrum when the source of light is in the line of sight. A system of prisms in it, made of two kinds of glass, is so arranged that deviation is corrected whilst dispersion is retained, this being possible from the fact that particular kinds of glass have a particular proportion of deviating to dispersing power.

The observations under these conditions give in all about twenty lines belonging to the metals magnesium, sodium, iron, strontium, barium, calcium, chromium, zinc, bismuth, and nickel, and four lines of unknown origin.

_Spectra of Meteorites at the Temperature of the Jar Spark._

At the temperature of the jar spark a very great number of lines is visible, and, up to the present, it has not been possible to make complete observations of meteoritic spectra under these conditions. These high temperature spectra, however, are not of so much importance to us in the present inquiry as those at low temperatures, for the reason that once we have obtained evidence of the composition of meteorites --- that is to say, of their spectroscopic composition --- we can also tell approximately what lines will be visible in the jar spark.

All the observations recorded, with the exception of a few of the preliminary ones, have been made on undoubted meteorites, fragments of which have been, in the kindest manner, placed at my disposal by the Trustees of the British Museum.

In these observations, if a line in the spectrum of a meteorite were coincident with a metallic line, with the dispersion employed, in the absence of the brightest line of that metal, the line was regarded as originating from some other substance. Thus a line was sometimes seen at 548, apparently coincident, with the dispersion employed, with the green lines of Strontium and Nickel; sometimes the brightest line of Strontium at 4607 was absent, and it was then fair to assume that the presence of 548 was due to Nickel, but in the presence of 4607 it might be due to Strontium.

_Comparisons of the foregoing Observations among themselves._

The discussions have taken, in the first instance, the form of comparisons of the different phenomena observed, and for this purpose all the observations of flutings and of bright lines have been carefully mapped, all records having been brought to a common scale.

The following are among the comparisons already dealt with:---

1\. The spectra of meteorites observed under the various conditions, chiefly considering magnesium, iron, and manganese, with the bright lines observed at low temperatures.

The main conclusions are ---

1\. That only the lowest temperature lines of Magnesium, Sodium, Iron, Chromium, Manganese, Strontium, Calcium, Barium, Potassium, Lead, Bismuth, and Nickel are seen in the meteorites under the various conditions. They are not all visible in one meteorite or under one particular condition; the details of individual observations are fully recorded in Figs. 11 and 12.

2\. That in the case of Magnesium the line most frequently seen is the remnant of the fluting at 500, while in a photograph the main ultra-violet line recorded is the one at 373, previously recorded under these conditions by Messrs. Liveing and Dewar. In the quantity spark other lines are seen, notably _b1_, _b2_, _b4_, and 521. The line at 500 was considerably brightened when the number of cells was reduced, thus showing it to be due to some molecule which can exist best at a low temperature.

3\. That in the case of Manganese the only line visible at the temperature of the Bunsen burner, 5395, is the only line seen in the meteorites, with the exception of one in the violet at 403.

4\. That the lines of iron seen in the meteorites are those which are brightest when wire gauze is burned in the flame; chief among these lines are 579, 5268, 4383, and 6024.

# Part 3. Meteorites in the Air.

## Chapter 7. Identity of Origin of Luminous Meteors and Falling Stars with Meteorites.

It is very fortunate for science that many of the meteorites so carefully preserved in our museums _have been seen to fall_. This being so we possess full accounts of the accompanying phenomena and effects.

These comprise the most vivid luminosity; visible and audible explosions, in some cases heard over thousands of square miles of country, and, at times, a long train in the sky sometimes remaining visible for hours and indicating the path of the meteor.

Now, precisely similar effects have been noted when nothing has reached the earth's surface; and in the thousands of records of the phenomena presented by luminous meteors, fire-balls, bolides, and shooting or falling stars as they have been variously called, we have the links which connect in the most complete manner the falls of actual irons and stones from heaven with the tiniest trail of a shooting or falling star, _une étoile qui file, qui file, et disparaît_.

The heavy masses fall by virtue of their substance and compactness resisting the friction of the air, the smaller bodies are at once burnt up and fill the upper regions of the earth's atmosphere with meteoritic dust.

The difference is only one of size, and on this ground I employ the word meteorite in this book to define the smallest as well as the largest masses.

As we have seen, the weights of meteorites which have actually fallen vary between many tons and a few ounces, the latter being, in all probability, fragments shattered by the explosion. In the case of some shooting-stars the actual weight involved has been estimated by Professor Herschel as low as _two grains_. In telescopic shooting-stars the weight must be very much less than this, not one out of twenty estimated by him exceeding a pound.

It may appear impossible that such atoms should produce the brilliant effects observed, but Professor Herschel has calculated that a single grain moving at the rate of 30 miles a second represents a dynamical energy of 55,675 foot-pounds. This energy is converted by the resistance of our grosser air into heat, as the motion of a projectile is converted into heat by its impact on the target;* and hence the combustion of the matter of the meteorite, and perhaps even the incandescence of the air through which it rushes with such considerable velocity. This luminosity often commences at a height of about 80 miles, and sometimes even higher, in regions where the atmosphere must be excessively rare.

*) The particles of iron in a large projectile, after impact, which is accompanied by a flash of light, are usually brought to a dark blue colour, which would correspond to about 555° F., but the momentary heat imparted is certainly greater than this.

Could these little bodies pierce our envelope as readily as do their larger kindred, the meteoritic stones and meteoritic irons, we should certainly have the advantage of placing them in our museums; but, on the other hand, the bombardment --- the _feu de ciel_ --- might be one to which the _feu d'enfer_ of all terrestrial artillery would be, in the gross total of results, as mere child's play.

But the identity of the concomitant phenomena is by no means the only line of evidence demonstrating the connection now in question.

_Proof afforded by the Spectra of Meteors and Shooting-Stars._

The spectral appearances observed with meteors, fire-balls, and shooting-stars, which explode and produce luminous effects, are entirely in harmony with those observations on the spectra of meteorites to which I have referred.

The observations, so far as they have gone, have given decided indications of magnesium, sodium, lithium, potassium, and of the carbon flutings seen in comets.

Professor Herschel and Herr Konkoly have both noticed that in the generality of cases the lines of magnesium (one of the constituents of the olivine) show themselves first in the ordinary meteor or falling star, and the beautiful green light, which is so often associated with these falling bodies, is due to the incandescence of the vapour of magnesium.

The following quotations from Konkoly and Professor Herschel are among the authorities which may be cited for the above statement:---

On 12th, 13th, and 14th August I observed a number of meteors with the spectroscope; amongst others, on the 12th, a yellow fire-ball with a fine train, which came directly from the Perseid radiant. In the head of this meteor the lines of lithium were clearly seen by the side of the sodium line. On 13th August, at 10h. 46m. 10s., I observed in the north-east a magnificent fire-ball of emerald-green colour, as bright as Jupiter, with a very slow motion. The nucleus at the first moment only showed a very bright continuous spectrum with the sodium line; but a second after I perceived the magnesium line, and I think I am not mistaken in saying those of copper also. Besides that, the spectrum showed two very faint red lines.*

*) Konkoly, _Observatory_, vol. 3. p. 157.

A few of the green "Leonid" streaks were noticed in November (1866) to be, to all appearances, monochromatic, or quite undispersed by vision through the refracting prisms; from which we may at least very probably infer (by later discoveries with the meteor-spectroscope) that the prominent green line of magnesium forms the principal constituent element of their greenish light.*

*) Professor Herschel, letter to _Nature_, vol. 24. p. 507.

Again, later on in the same letter, Professor Herschel mentions Konkoly's observation of the bright _b_ line of magnesium, in addition to the yellow sodium line, in a meteor on 26th July 1873. I again quote from Professor Herschel ---

On the morning of 13th October in the same year, Herr von Konkoly again observed with Browning's meteor-spectroscope the long-enduring streak of a large fire-ball, which was visible to the north-east of O'Gyalla. It exhibited the yellow sodium line and the green line of magnesium very finely, besides other spectral lines in the red and green. Examining these latter lines closely with a star-spectroscope attached to an equatorial telescope, Herr von Konkoly succeeded in identifying them by direct comparison with the lines in an electric Geissler-tube of marsh-gas. They were visible in the star-spectroscope for eleven minutes, after which the sodium and magnesium lines still continued to be very brightly observable through the meteor-spectroscope.*

*) Herschel, letter to _Nature_, vol. 24. p. 507. See also _Astr. Nach._, No. 2014.

Another series of observations* gives continuous spectra for the nucleus, and two trains with sodium, and a third with sodium and a predominant green band, which was doubtless _b_ of magnesium, the meteor itself being of emerald-green colour.

*) _Monthly Notices_, vol. 23. p. 575.

In cases where the temperature has been higher, the bright line spectrum of iron has been associated with the bright lines of magnesium in the spectrum of the falling star, so that the two substances which are among the chief constituents of stones and irons --- precisely the two substances which we should expect to find --- are actually those which have been observed. The two lines which Konkoly supposes to be probably due to copper will, I expect, be found to be iron lines when other observations are made of the spectra of meteors.

These spectral appearances are naturally associated with colours, and again we find that the colours of the trail, when meteorites have fallen, closely resemble those observed when no fall has been observed. Green is a tolerably common colour, especially in slow-moving fire-balls about equal to Venus in lustre. These generally leave a short trail of red sparks.

About 10 per cent of all shooting-stars show a distinct colour, the most usual being orange or red, the slow-moving ones generally being red. The larger ones, or those with the longest trails, often turn from orange to bluish-white, like burning magnesium. Sometimes the change is very sudden and startling.*

*) Corder, _Monthly Notices_, vol. 40, p. 133.

A purple or mauve tint, like that given by copper, is sometimes remarked.

_Proof afforded by Similar Velocities._

Again, the meteorites, as we have seen, enter our atmosphere with very different velocities. The same thing happens with falling stars, which on this account have been divided into three classes as follows ---

Class 1. Swift, streak-leaving meteors.  
Class 2. Slow, with trains of sparks.  
Class 3. Small, quick, short-pathed, sometimes with streaks.

It has also been determined that the luminous effect which is common to the fall of a meteorite or the appearance of a shooting-star begins at relatively different heights. In fact, we have in meteorites, large fire-balls, and shooting-stars, a progression both with regard to the height at which they become visible and the nearness to the earth at which their luminosity is extinguished.

The actual determination of these heights was commenced by two Göttingen students --- Brandes and Benzenberg --- in 1798, at the suggestion of Chladni, with the result that the upper reaches of the earth's atmosphere were found to be pierced by bodies entering it with planetary velocities.

Professors Herschel and Newton were the first to discuss the data accumulated on this subject,* while, as early as 1864, Father Secchi made use of the electric telegraph in securing simultaneous observations.* The results of these combined inquiries may be thus shown in the case of shooting-stars ---

|Beginning. Height in miles.|End. Height in miles.|Authority.  
Europe and America, 1798-1863|70.1|54.2|H.  
Europe and America, 1798-1863|73.5|50.6|N.  
Italy, 1864|74.6|49.7|S.  
Average|72.7|51.5|

In Herschel's values fire-balls are excluded, and hence the limits are narrower.* Fire-balls often arrive within 20 miles of the earth's surface, and then the concussion is of nearly the same intensity whether stones fall or not. Denning finds the average beginning-heights of meteors generally is 76.4 miles (from 683 computed paths), and the average end-heights 50.8 miles (from 756 computed paths). The usual end-height of ordinary shooting-stars is 54 miles, and of fire-balls 30 miles.*

*) _Journal_, Liverpool Astr. Soc., vol. 7. p. 128.

Such determinations as these, when the observations can be depended upon, can be made with the greatest nicety and by graphical methods. One of the earliest employed --- a description of which will give a fair idea of the investigation --- is due to Colonel Laussedat.*

*) _Comptes Rendus_, vol. 58. p. 1100, 1864.

The observations stating the path of each meteor among the stars having been obtained, a 12-inch celestial globe is "rectified" in the usual manner for the place and time. In this way we get first the azimuth and altitude of the beginning and end of each trail. This is done for every place at which the same meteor is observed.

The results are then plotted on a large scale map, on which the latitudes and longitudes of the places of observation and the distances between them can be determined. The altitudes and distances permit the heights at the intersection of the lines of sight to be at once found, and the agreement or disagreement of the observations can be noticed, thus allowing inaccurate observations to be rejected.

By utilising such observations as these, it is possible not only to determine the heights of meteors, but also to discover the special places on the earth over which they are visible, as well as the velocity with which they traverse the atmosphere. The lowest velocity determined up to the present time is something like 2 miles per second; the maximum is something like 50 miles a second; but we may say that the average rate of movement is 30 miles a second, which is about 150 times faster than a shell leaving one of our most powerful guns.

## Chapter 8. The Aurora a Phenomenon produced by the Dust of Meteors and Falling Stars.

I have already stated that Professor Newton and others have calculated that not less than 20,000,000 of meteorites, each large enough to present us with the phenomenon of a shooting-star visible to the naked eye, enter our atmosphere daily. If this be conceded, the outer parts of our atmosphere must be constantly charged with meteoritic dust, whether oxidised or not, in a state of suspension, while it is possible that the earth encounters particles finer than that which produces the phenomena of falling stars. This being so, if we can trace this dust in the air, or after it has fallen, or both --- if chemical examination shows it to be identical with that of meteorites --- we shall be supplied with another argument which can be used in support of the fact that the bodies which produce the dust are meteoritic in their origin.

It is natural to suppose that meteors in their passage through the air break into fragments; that incandescent particles of their constituents, including nickel-iron, manganese, and the various silicates, are thrown off; and that these, or the products of their combustion, eventually fall to the surface as almost impalpable dust, among which must be magnetic oxide of iron more or less completely fused. The luminous trains of falling stars are probably due to the combustion of these innumerable particles, resembling the sparks which fly from a ribbon of iron burnt in oxygen, or the particles of the same metal thrown off when striking a flint. It is known that such particles in burning take a spherical form, and are surrounded by a layer of black magnetic oxide.

How are we to trace this dust in the air? It is well known that at times the air is electrically illuminated, not only by the flashes of lightning which pass along its lower levels, but by so-called "auroral" displays in its higher reaches, and the only means open to us of determining the presence or absence of this dust in the higher regions of the air is by observations of the atmosphere containing it when it is rendered luminous by electrical discharges. It is clear that in such a case as this the spectroscope is the only chemical aid applicable, and it has long been recognised that the spectrum observed is _not_ the spectrum of the constituents of the atmosphere, as we can study it in our laboratories.

It becomes necessary, therefore, to make a thorough investigation of the spectrum of the aurora borealis from the point of view that meteoritic dust, if it exists, is likely to assert itself in any electrical excitation of the atmosphere.

It is now many years since the idea was first thrown out that the aurora was in some way connected with shooting-stars. The connection was first suggested by Olmsted in 1833.* In M. Zenger's catalogue of aurorae observed from 1800 to 1877, he shows an apparent connection between the brightest displays and the appearance of large numbers of shooting-stars. M. Denza remarked the same connection on 27th November 1872, and that he had noticed it before. Admiral Wrangel, as quoted by Humboldt, observed that in the aurorae so constantly seen on the Siberian coast, the passage of a meteor never failed to extend the luminosity to parts of the sky previously dark.

*) _Silliman's Journal_, vols. 35., 36.

In spite of these ideas, even after the chemical nature of shooting-stars was known, observers have in the main contented themselves with making comparisons of the aurora spectrum with the spectrum of air under different conditions of temperature and pressure.

It has never been possible, however, to reconcile the aurora spectrum with any known spectrum of air. Some observers are of opinion that the lines seen in the aurora coincide with air-lines, but have different intensities, and attempt to overcome this difficulty by assuming that the aurora spectrum is produced under conditions which we are unable to imitate in our laboratories.

It is necessary to state that the existing observations of aurora spectra show such great differences of wave-length for what are probably the same lines, that it is somewhat difficult to assign origins for the lines. These discrepancies occur not only in the measures made by different observers, but in those made at different periods by the same observer. Further, the individual observations are seldom recorded, but in place of them are given the means of several observations, and in some cases the means have been obtained by grouping together lines which are very far apart. At best, therefore, it is only possible to suggest the probable origin of the lines and bands seen.

_Ångström's First Observations._

The spectroscope was employed in investigating the nature of the aurora spectrum by Ångström in 1867.* He found that the light was almost perfectly monochromatic, the spectrum consisting mainly of a yellow-green line at a wave-length given by him as 5567. With a wide slit other faint bands were visible.

*) _Le Spectre Normal du Soleil_, p. 41.

The note is so short that I give it in full; translated it reads thus ---

1868. --- From the time of Franklin's memorable observations on electricity up to the present there has been such a perfect agreement between the actions of this natural force and those of frictional electricity, that it was easy to foresee that the spectrum of lightning must be the same as that produced by the ordinary electric discharge in air. The observations made by M. Kundt have perfectly proved this. The two phenomena of the aurora borealis and of terrestrial magnetism being so closely connected with each other, that the appearance of the aurora is always accompanied by disturbances of the magnetic needle, it might be supposed that the aurora borealis was only an electric flash, which is, however, not the case. During the winter of 1867-68 I was able several times to observe the spectrum of the luminous arc which borders the dark segment, and is always present in faint auroræ. Its light was almost monochromatic, and consisted of one bright line, on the left of a group of calcium lines. I determined the wave-length of the line, which was equal to λ = 5567. Beyond this line, the intensity of which is relatively great, I observed also, by increasing the width of the slit, traces of three very faint bands which extended almost to F. On one occasion only, where the luminous arc was agitated by undulations which changed its form, I saw the regions in question lighted momentarily by some faint spectral lines; but considering the lack of intensity of the rays, it may still be said that the light of the luminous arc is sensibly monochromatic.

Here is a circumstance which gives this observation on the spectrum of the aurora borealis a greater and even cosmic importance. During a week of the month of March 1867 I succeeded in observing the same spectral line in the zodiacal light, which had then an extraordinary intensity for the latitude of Upsala. At last, during a starlight night, the whole heavens being in a manner phosphorescent, I found traces of it even in the faint light emitted from all parts of the firmament. A very remarkable fact is that the line in question coincides with none of the known lines in the spectra of simple or compound gases, at least so far as I have studied them at present. It follows from what I have said that an intense aurora borealis, such as may be observed above the polar circle, will probably give a more complicated spectrum than that which I saw. Supposing that to be the fact, it may be hoped that in the future it will be possible to explain more easily the origin of the lines found and the nature of the phenomenon itself. Not being able to give this explanation at present, I propose to turn to it another time.

_Zöllner's View._

In the _Report to the Royal Saxon Academy of Sciences_, October 1871, Zöllner expressed the opinion that the temperature of the incandescent gas of the aurora must be very low. He affirmed that the spectrum does not correspond with that of any known substance, and suggests, therefore, that it may be one given by air under some peculiar condition which cannot be experimentally reproduced. (A translation of Zöllner's paper is given in the _Philosophical Magazine_, vol. 41. p. 122.)

_Vogel's Views._

Vogel also makes the same affirmation, and comes to the same conclusion as Zöllner, namely, that the spectrum of the aurora is one which cannot be artificially produced. He suggests that it may be the integrated spectrum of several layers which exists under different conditions (_Reports of the Royal Saxony Academy of Sciences_, 1871).* He points out that the characteristic line in the aurora spectrum observed by Ångström is coincident with a very faint line of nitrogen. That this line should appear in the aurora spectrum with enhanced intensity he regards as quite consistent with the known variability of gas spectra under various conditions of temperature and pressure. He also points out the possible coincidence of one of the lines with a line in the negative pole spectrum of nitrogen at wave-length 5224, of another with an oxygen line at 5189, and of another with the strong nitrogen line 5004. The red line in the spectrum he regards as having the same origin as the group of lines in the spectrum of nitrogen which extends from 6213 to 6620, and brightens towards the violet end, the change in appearance being due to the faintness of the aurora. This, however, is not likely to be the case, as the red line has been seen both bright and sharp (R. H. Proctor, "Aurora," _Encyclopaedia Britannica_).

*) A translation of Vogel's paper is given by Capron, _Auroræ_, p. 194.

In the same paper, Vogel shows the close coincidences between the aurora lines and lines in the spectrum of iron, but considers it more in accordance with probability to regard the aurora spectrum as a modification of the spectrum of atmospheric air.

_Ångström's further Observations and Conclusions._

In a later paper (_Nature_, vol. 10. p. 210), Ångström arrives at conclusions which may be thus briefly stated ---

1\. That the aurora has two different spectra, one consisting of the characteristic line, and the other of the fainter lines.

2\. That the coincidences of the bright green line with a faint line in the spectrum of air, as determined by Dr. Vogel, is purely accidental, and also that there is no coincidence of any importance with any member of the hydrocarbon group in which it falls.

3\. That the bright line is probably due to fluorescence or phosphorescence.

4\. That Vogel's theory of unknown conditions of temperature and pressure being competent to produce the change from the ordinary experimental spectrum of air to that given by the aurora is inadmissible.  (Ångström regarded the spectrum of a gas as invariable.)

5\. That moisture may be neglected in considering the nature of the aurora spectrum.

He describes an experiment on a glow equivalent to the glow of the negative pole of an air vacuum-tube, in which the spectrum obtained showed close coincidences with three faint lines in the aurora spectrum. A layer of phosphoric anhydride is spread over the bottom of a flask fitted with platinum wires; after exhaustion with an air-pump, the current from an induction coil is passed between the two platinums. The flask then becomes filled with a violet light like that which, under ordinary conditions, only appears at the negative pole. The spectrum of this light shows the following close coincidences with that of the aurora:---

Auroræ Barker|431|470.5|...  
Auroræ Vogel|...|469.4|523.3  
Auroræ Ångström|...|472.0|521.0  
Auroræ Lemström|426.2|469.4|523.5  
Means|428.6|470.3|522.6  
Violet Light|427.2|470.7|522.7 

Although this coincidence is rather striking, it must be remembered that there are other strong bands in the spectrum of the negative pole which do not appear in aurora spectra. As mapped by Hasselberg, the spectrum of the negative pole consists of a series of bright flutings shaded off towards the violet, the brightest edges of them being at wave-lengths 419.8, 423.6, 427.8, 451.5, 455.4, 459.9, 465.1, 470.8, all these are of equal intensities* (see Fig. 13).

*) _Mémoires de l'Academic Impériale des Sciences de St. Pétersburg_, Series 7., vol. 32. No. 15.

Capron remarks that "if the violet pole glow spectrum is to represent the aurora spectrum, it must be under conditions different from those by which it obtains in dry-air vacuum tubes or flasks at ordinary temperatures" (_Auroræ_, p. 126).

There can, therefore, be little doubt that the aurora spectrum has nothing in common with the negative pole spectrum of nitrogen, and that the three close coincidences noted by Ångström are merely accidental.

With regard to Ångström's remark that Vogel's theory that the aurora spectrum is a spectrum of air under unknown conditions is inadmissible, we now know that gas spectra are not so invariable as Ångström supposed; but still we have no right to assume that any particular change is possible until we can prove it experimentally, or at the very least, prove an approach to such a change. If we assume that any change may take place in any spectrum, we upset the whole basis of spectrum analysis.

_Comparison of the Aurora Spectrum with the Negative Pole Spectrum of Oxygen._

The negative pole spectrum of oxygen, as mapped by Schuster (_Phil. Trans._ Part 1., 1879), consists of four broad bands, the two brightest having the following positions:---

5205.0 Brightest part 5255  
5292.5 Brightest part 5255

5552.8 Brightest part 5586  
5629.6 Brightest part 5586

Under great dispersion, these bands break up into series of lines. The proximity of the brightest part of one band (5586) to the aurora line is notable, but considering that the aurora line is always sharp, Schuster concludes that there is no connection between the spectrum of the aurora and that of the negative pole glow of oxygen (quoted by Capron, _Auroræ_, p. 130).

_Comparison with the Spectrum of Hydrogen._

Similarly, all attempts to identify the spectrum of the aurora with that of hydrogen, another constituent of our atmosphere (in the form of water vapour), have failed. On this point Capron remarks: "No principal line and one subsidiary line only,* actually coincide with the aurora spectrum, this last being that to which Dr. Vogel assigns an identical wave-length, viz. 5189" (_Auroræ_, p. 109).

*) The subsidiary lines of hydrogen constitute what I have elsewhere described as the structure spectrum of hydrogen.

That this coincidence is of no importance is obvious when it is remembered that there are a great number of such lines in the spectrum of hydrogen, and that no experiments have been recorded indicating that this line is more persistent than the others.

_Comparison with the Spectrum of Phosphoretted Hydrogen._

Next in importance to comparisons of the aurora spectrum with air spectra is the comparison with the flame of phosphoretted hydrogen, in connection with Ångström's suggestion that the characteristic green line may be due to phosphorescence or fluorescence. The spectrum of phosphoretted hydrogen consists of several bands, the centres of the four brightest being at 526.3, 510.6, 560.5, and 599.4 (Lecoq de Boisbaudran, _Spectres Lumineux_, p. 189). These bands brighten when the flame is artificially cooled, especially the less refrangible ones.

On this subject Capron says ---

Having regard to the near proximity of the phosphoretted hydrogen band to the bright aurora line, to the circumstance of this band brightening by reduction of temperature (a phenomenon probably connected with ozone), to the peculiar brightening of one line in the green in the "aurora" and "phosphorescent" tubes (the phosphorescent tubes probably containing O), and to the observed circumstance that the electric discharge has a phosphorescent or fluorescent afterglow (isolated, I believe, by Faraday), I feel there is strong evidence in favour of such an origin to the principal aurora line, if not to the red line as well (_Auroræ_, p. 126).

But the mere fact of one of the phosphoretted hydrogen bands, and that only the third in order of brightness, falling near the characteristic aurora line cannot be supposed to be anything more than accidental, unless the absence of the two brightest bands can be explained. As this cannot be done, the suggestion may be disregarded.

The information given about the green line seen in the phosphorescent tube by Capron is sufficient for any conclusions to be arrived at.

_Groeneman's Meteoric Dust Theory._

So far we have had chiefly to deal with theories in which the aurora spectrum is regarded as being inseparable from that of atmospheric air, but we have next to consider one which, if true, would give a totally different origin.

In 1874 Groeneman (_Ast. Nach._ No. 2010) resuscitated the theory of Olmsted that the aurora has its origin in the fall of incandescent meteoric dust.* The iron particles are regarded as being competent to produce the magnetic phenomena which accompany auroræ. This theory was not received very favourably, because it left the spectroscopic phenomena as far from a solution as ever. Thus Capron remarks (_Auroræ_, p. 170) that "if auroræ were composed of incandescent glowing meteors, it would be reasonable to expect to find in the spectrum the lines of iron, a metal constituting so prominently the composition of meteorites. No connection between the iron and the aurora spectrum is, however, proved, though it may be suspected. The iron spectrum contains so many lines that some may, as a mere accidental circumstance, closely agree with the aurora lines." Yogel also considers that we are not entitled to regard the close coincidences of the aurora lines with some of the iron lines as complete evidence of iron vapour, until we have succeeded in showing by experiments that the relative intensities of the iron lines are subject to great changes, and in this way accounting for the appearance of faint lines in the aurora spectrum, or, on the other hand, for the absence of the strongest lines. I shall show subsequently what experiments have now conclusively proved the presence of iron.

*) This theory was subsequently discussed in an appendix to the _Memorie della, Societa degli Spectroscopisti Italiani_, 1878.

_Mr. Capron's Conclusions._

In reviewing the theories suggested up to 1879, to explain the origin of aurorse, Mr. Eand Capron makes the following statement: ---

As the general result of spectrum work on the aurora up to the present time, we seem to have quite failed in finding any spectrum which, as to position, intensity, and general character of lines, well coincides with that of the aurora. Indeed, we may say we do not find any spectrum so nearly allied to portions even of the aurora spectrum as to lead us to conclude that we have discovered the true nature of one spectrum of the aurora (supposing it to comprise, as some consider, two or more). The whole subject may be characterised as still a scientific mystery (_Auroræ_, p. 171).

_Lemström's Observations._

The next contribution to our knowledge of aurora spectra of any importance is that of Lemström's (_L'Aurore Boréale_, 1886). All previous observers who attempted to identify the spectrum of the aurora with that of atmospheric air failed to do so, but Lemström asserts (p. 158) that the twelve lines which have been recorded in aurora spectra are nearly all seen in the spectrum of a Geissler-tube containing the same gases as those constituting our atmosphere. The differences in the relative intensities he believes to be due to conditions of temperature and pressure.* Although the auroral line (wave-length 557) does not agree perfectly with the line at 558 seen in the spectrum given by his _appareil de l'aurore boréale_ (air vacuum-tubes illuminated by sparks from a Holtz machine), he regards the atmospheric origin of the aurora spectrum as completely demonstrated. He states (p. 138) that the characteristic line of the aurora spectrum is always seen in the light produced by the discharge of an electric current (by means of his _appareil d'écoulement_) from the top of a mountain. He gives a table of auroral lines compared with the lines in the spectra of rarefied air, as observed by himself, and by Vogel and Sundell under other conditions. The air lines recorded by Vogel nearly all coincide with lines recorded as oxygen lines by Schuster (_Phil. Trans._ Part 1. 1879); but it is important to note that some of the strongest lines mapped by Schuster are absent from Vogel's list (see Fig. 13). So that, even if we allow that some of the aurora lines fall near lines of oxygen, the absence of the brightest oxygen lines from the spectrum is sufficient evidence for us to safely conclude that we are not dealing with the line spectrum of oxygen. We have previously seen that it is not the negative pole spectrum of oxygen.

*) "Si l'on se demande pourquoi on ne voit point dans l'aurore polaire toutes les raies existant dans ces gaz, l'experience répond que les raies des gaz changent selon la température et la pression de ces gaz" (_L'Aurore Boréale_, p. 158).

In the same table (_L'Aurore Boréale_, p. 92), the aurora lines are compared with some of the lines or bands observed in the spectrum of rarefied air by Lemström. The air lines which he gives all agree in position with some of the nitrogen flutings mapped by Hasselberg (_Mémoires de l'Académie Impériale de St. Pétersbourg_, Series 7., vol. 32., No. 15). One of them is at wave-length 558, and this he believes to be coincident with the aurora line 557. The intensity of the line is not given, but Hasselberg gives it as a comparatively feeble fluting at 557 (see Fig. 13). Considering the absence of the brightest nitrogen flutings from the spectrum of the aurora, the supposed coincidences between some of Lemström's rarefied air lines and lines in the aurora spectrum, which are far from perfection, may be disregarded.

The same objections apply to the lines in the rarefied air spectrum which have been recorded by Sundell; those which fall anywhere near lines in the aurora are comparatively faint flutings or lines in the spectrum of nitrogen; at all events, flutings of the same or greater intensities are absent, and there is no evidence to show that the coincident ones retain their brightness as the others fade.

Lemström thus leaves the origin of the aurora spectrum as uncertain as ever. There is no evidence to show that it is a spectrum of air, or, indeed, of any other gas. If it be a spectrum of air, it is one which has never been obtained experimentally, and one which can only be put forward by making unphilosophical assumptions and carefully avoiding experiments.

_Gyllenskiöld's Observations and Conclusions._

Still later observations of the aurora which have been published are those made at Cape Thorsden by M. Carlheim-Gyllenskiöld.* Two lists of lines are given, one from observations made with a Hofmann spectroscope, and the other from observations made with a Wrede spectroscope. The lines in the first list extend from blue to red, and those in the second list from green to violet. The individual observations of different aurorse with the lines observed in each are given. 36 auroræ are recorded in which only 1 line was visible, 15 in which there were only 2 lines, 6 with 3 lines, 15 with 4 lines, 5 with 6 lines, 4 with 7 lines, 1 with 8, 1 with 9, and 1 with 10 lines, so that altogether no less than 84 observations are recorded.

*) _Observations faites au Cap Thorsden, Spitzberg, par V Expédition Suédoise_, vol. 2. p. 1. _Aurora Borealis_, par Carlheim-Gyllenskiöld.

The total number of lines seen was 32.  Gyllenskiöld's main conclusions are ---

1\. That 16 of the aurora lines nearly coincide with air lines, 8 with the positive pole spectrum of nitrogen, 4 with the negative pole spectrum of nitrogen, and 3 with lines of hydrogen.

2\. That the aurora spectrum greatly resembles that of lightning, and he regards it as consisting of several superposed spectra.  The variable character of the spectrum is accounted for by the absence sometimes of one, sometimes of another, of these elementary spectra.

3\. That the brightness of the aurora does not depend upon the energy of the electrical discharge which produces it, but upon some cause with which we are not acquainted.

4\. Two kinds of auroræ are distinguished, --- red and yellow. In the former, the positive pole spectrum of nitrogen is predominant, while in the latter the negative pole spectrum is predominant. Laboratory experiments have shown that the positive pole spectrum of nitrogen is given by dense moist air, while the negative pole spectrum is given by rarefied dry air; and Gyllenskiöld suggests that the yellow auroræ are formed in the higher parts of the atmosphere, and the red ones in the lower layers.

5\. That the observations bear out Ångström's suggestion that some of the bands belong to the negative pole spectrum of nitrogen. He says: "Nos observations confirment done l'opinion d'Ångström, que les bandes faiblement lumineuses de l'aurore boréale appartiennent au spectre du pôle negatif; auxquelles les bandes et les lignes de l'azote se joignent dans certains cas." He observes that the characteristic line of the aurora appears in company with the negative pole spectrum, and says it is probable that some of the more refrangible bands of the positive pole spectrum also appear at the same time. Both the positive and negative pole spectra are very rich in violet and ultra-violet rays, and Gyllenskiöld's observations support Ångström's view, that the characteristic line is due to the fluorescence of oxygen produced by the violet light of the negative pole.

This fluorescence, however, cannot be reproduced in experiments with Geissler-tubes, and M. Gyllenskiöld concludes that the origin of the characteristic line still remains unexplained, but he suggests that its origin may eventually be discovered by investigation of the fluorescent spectra of various chemical substances.

The characteristic aurora line therefore remains unexplained by M. Gyllenskiöld. As regards the remaining lines, he states that sixteen nearly coincide with air lines, but it is important to note that these are not the sixteen strongest air lines. Some of the lines fall near to bands in the positive pole spectrum of nitrogen, as Gyllenskiöld points out; but equally strong or stronger bands are not seen in the aurora, so that the coincidences are only accidental. The same applies to the bands in the negative pole spectrum.

Like Lemström, then, Gyllenskiöld makes no advance as regards the origin of the spectrum of the aurora, but at the same time it is only fair to acknowledge the value of the observations. With regard to the third conclusion, my work suggestst hat the brightness of the aurora may depend upon the varying quantities of meteoritic dust in the atmosphere at different times.

I have next to refer to my own observations and comparisons.
